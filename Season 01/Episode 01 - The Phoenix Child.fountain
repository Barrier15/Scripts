FADE IN:  

EXT. EMBER ONE IN HERCULANEUM SHIPYARD

The dim light of a red dwarf star bathes the tidally locked planet of Herculaneum. Thick, ashen clouds streak from the light side of the planet to the dark. While a ring of space stations orbit above, and white lights from vast cities shine through the clouds at the twilight border and extend back thousands of miles into the night side of the planet.

BRIANNA POLYWELL, a young biracial engineer dons EVA space suit number "8" as she stands on the hull of the nearly completed *Ember One*, a large, trilobite-like ship with four enormous engine nacelles jetting out from the body in place of the legs.

!TITLE CARD  

Construction robots continuously position prefabricated segments into the ship and fasten them using specialized arms. Brianna monitors the machines from a holographic display projected on her visor as their task nears completion. She cheers and pumps her fists into the "air" as the last piece is nano-welded into place. A holographic message is projected on her visor:

	\*\*\* PHASE ONE CONSTRUCTION COMPLETE \*\*\*


Then, another notification appears on her visor: "Morning Stand-Up Meeting in 0 minutes."

BRIANNA
Oh, crap.

INT. SHIPYARD OBSERVATION DECK - DAY

At the center of the room is an old model of a ship with an enormous ring around its hull. A caption reads: "The Prodigal Sun: The only vessel ever to travel via wormhole."

Now wearing her work coveralls, Brianna sprints by, triggering the display to activate. Lights turn on, and a recording plays.

RECORDING VOICE (O.S.)
Considered by many to be Herculaneum's greatest engineering achievement, the Prodigal Sun was commissioned to determine the fate of Earth after the Singularity War...

INT. SHIPYARD ENGINEERING OFFICE - DAY

Brianna attempts to sneak through the doorway unseen when...

TOKAMAK (O.S.)
Ms. Polywell...

Brianna spins around to see her supervisor, ALEXI TOKAMAK. The stern, portly middle-aged man scowls at her.

TOKAMAK (CONT.)
...So kind of you to join us. Pity the meeting's already over.

BRIANNA
Sorry I'm late, Mr. Tokamak. I was busy and lost track of time--

TOKAMAK
Spare me the excuses, Polywell. I already know about your unauthorized, all-night spacewalk.

BRIANNA
(to herself)
Katy.

TOKAMAK
Don't blame Ms. Patel. She did the right thing. EVAs are inherently dangerous. You're lucky I don't have you dismissed for a stunt like that.
(beat)
At least tell me you refilled the O2 tank on Suit #8.

BRIANNA
(Voice pitched up)
Yeah... Of course.

With a motion of his hand, Tokamak calls up a holographic interface.

TOKAMAK
I'm giving you a new assignment.
(pressing a button on the interface)
 Noah, come in here.

NOAH GREYSON walks in. He's a lanky young gentleman, neat as a pin, who exudes competence and politeness. Brianna grins and waves. He nods in acknowledgement.

BRIANNA
I'm not initializing the artificial intelligence?

Tokamak selects a task from a list on his interface and throws it in Brianna's direction, where it expands into a full window.

BRIANNA
(reading)
You want me to upgrade the DNA of the biochips in the power control systems? Why? Just because the factory default doesn't have that damned Remote Management Core?--

TOKAMAK
Oh, I forgot about your little conspiracy theory.

BRIANNA
The RMC's a chip within a chip. It has total root control of the entire system.

TOKAMAK
It performs automatic updates. Did you want to update several hundred biochips by hand? Besides, the RMC can't run any code that wasn't ***digitally signed at the factory***. It's beneficial, like the mitochondria inside your cells.

BRIANNA
More like a parasitic organism, like the Emerald Cockroach Wasp, or Toxoplasma Gondii--

TOKAMAK
Enough! This is not a debate. Give your notes to Mr. Greyson. He'll be taking your previous assignment.

NOAH
Excuse me, sir, but would it be alright if I took her task. I've never performed an upgrade on this controller model.

TOKAMAK
(confused)
You don't want the A.I. task?

NOAH
Give it to Brianna. She's already done the research anyway. Besides, she won't make the same mistake twice, right Brianna?

Tokamak glares at Brianna. She nods frantically in agreement, then he looks back at Noah.

TOKAMAK
Very well.

As he changes the assignments, Brianna mouths the words "thank you" to Noah. As Tokamak turns toward her, she snaps to attention.

TOKAMAK
Polywell, report to the main computer core. Oversight will meet you there.

Tokamak removes a case labeled "Level 3 AI Initialization" from the shelf and hands it to Brianna, but when she takes hold of it, he doesn't let go.

TOKAMAK
This is your last chance. I want this task completed by the book, down to the last detail, or when we all leave for Earth, you won't be coming with us.

He releases the case and leaves. Brianna walks over to Noah, who removes something from his pocket.

NOAH
I'm sorry. I couldn't fix your old holoband, so I bought you a new one and transferred over all your files.

BRIANNA
Oh, don't worry about it. That thing never worked right anyways. Thanks.

As Noah hands her the HOLOBAND, she drops it and leans down to pick it up. A NECKLACE tucked into her coveralls slips out. The pendant on the necklace is a silver cross on top of a simplified gold DNA helix.

Brianna, mortified, quickly tucks the pendant back into her shirt.

NOAH
It's okay...

He produces a traditional crucifix cross from his own shirt, then quickly tucks it away.

NOAH (CONT.)
...I know what it's like to be a person of faith these days. Your secret's safe with me.

Noah gives Brianna a slight, genuine smile. Then he looks away, and his smile fades.

NOAH
Well, we should both get to work.

BRIANNA
Um, okay.
(rubs her bottom lip)
I'll see you later, then.

They slowly turn away from each other, and each of the leaves through separate exits.

INT. SHIPYARD LOADING DOCK

As Brianna heads for the ship's cargo gangway, case in hand, SAMANTHA STRATA is arguing with a DOCK WORKER about a crate suspended above her on an anti-gravity pallet. She wears a faded, frayed jumpsuit and no makeup. Her blond hair is tied into a messy bun.

SAMANTHA
I didn't want it shipped in the first place. Can't you just store it somewhere--?

DOCK WORKER
I'm sorry ma'am, this ain't a commercial storage facility. Either you claim it, or we recycle it.

Lights on one side of the floating pallet begin to flicker. The crate begins to list and slide off in Samantha's direction. Before it can crush her, Brianna drops her case and catches the crate.

SAMANTHA
Are you alright? That thing has to be over 90 kilos.

BRIANNA
I'm fine. They keep the gravity low in here. It's barely one G.

Brianna sets the crate down.

SAMANTHA
Uh. Hey. My name's Samantha. Samantha Strata.

BRIANNA
Brianna Polywell.

SAMANTHA
Hey Bree, could you do me a favor? I need some place to stash this crate. Just a couple of days. Can you help me out?

BRIANNA
Um. Sure.
(To the Dock Worker)
Put it in my quarters.

DOCK WORKER
You sure?

BRIANNA
Yeah.
(Back to Samantha)
But you owe me now.

SAMANTHA
Yeah. My life. Twice.

BRIANNA
I was thinking more along the lines of you buying me a lunch.

She picks up the case and walks toward the cargo gangway.

BRIANNA
I've got work to do. I'll catch you later.

Brianna rushes out as Samantha waves goodbye. Samantha begins to grin widely when she's out of sight.

INT. EMBER ONE CORRIDOR - DAY

As Brianna approaches the A.I. Computer Room, two people are standing near the door.

CAPTAIN KAI LE GUIN, transhuman genetically engineered to be both male and female, stands near the door to the AI Computer Room. They're a perfect fusion of James Bond and Carmen Sandiego in a single, immaculate uniform.

They're having a heated discussion with a large, imposing android wearing a custom black uniform with yellow trim. He is a avatar of OVERSIGHT. The two stand toe-to-toe, neither showing any fear of the other.

Brianna ducks behind a wall and peaks around the corner to watch.

OVERSIGHT
...No starship in the history of the Orion-Cygnus Alliance has ever utilized an artificial intelligence with a rated higher than Level 2. Having a ship AI that can feel and experience, in my opinion, can only serve to endanger the lives of crew.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
You may of course to lodge a complaint with Initiative Command--

OVERSIGHT
--I already have.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
However, I've already been granted full dispensation to have a Level 3 AI installed, and I do not have to explain my reasoning to you. The initialization will happen as scheduled, and you are required by your Mandate to supervise. Is that understood?

OVERSIGHT
(beat)
So be it, Captain.

The Captain walks away. Oversight walks into...

AI COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

The room is large and circular. The top of a computer core dominates the center of the room. A menacing, obsidian crescent-shaped core of roughly equal volume envelops the AI computer core, as if to physically restrain it.

Oversight approaches a console inset into the crescent core. He places his hands over the console, and it glows yellow.

A holographic interface appears, displaying upload progress. When the upload reaches 10%, a circular ring and other internal elements light up with a similar yellow glow at the heart of the crescent core.

Brianna enters the room with the AI kit. Oversight looks up.

OVERSIGHT
Good morning, Ms. Polywell. I'll be with you momentarily.

As the upload percentage counts up, progressively smaller circles along the central arc of the crescent light up. Lines of light begin to circuitously radiate from the circles to the edges of the crescent.

The upload completes, and the progress dialog is replaced with a readout: "AI Rating: 3.92"

Brianna places the AI kit on a console directly opposite to Oversight on the exposed side of the computer core.

BRIANNA
You must be Oversight. I've heard a lot about you.

Oversight starts walking around the core towards Brianna.

OVERSIGHT
Really? And what is it you've heard?

BRIANNA
Well... That you monitor every sentient AI in the Alliance to ensure that they don't present a danger to the public...

OVERSIGHT
(a third of the way to Brianna)
Go on.

BRIANNA
And you have a massive warehouse filled with the android bodies of AIs you... uh... apprehended... which you use as your avatars.

Brianna's expression changes as she realizes that one of those android bodies is in the room with her.

OVERSIGHT
(two thirds of the way to Brianna)
All true. What else?

BRIANNA
You're some kind of war hero from the Singularity War. Oversight stops dead.

OVERSIGHT
What would you know of the Singularity War?

BRIANNA
Uh, only that there was this massive war where an artificial superintelligence tried to take over the Earth, and you helped destroy it.

Oversight, his cold facade starting to crack, quickly walks to within a foot of Brianna. She leans back, visibly frightened, but stands her ground.

OVERSIGHT
As the only artificial superintelligence to survive the Singularity War, let me assure you, Ms. Polywell, that you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

Oversight regains his composure and steps back.

OVERSIGHT (CONT.)
You may begin.

Brianna's shaking hands undo the clasps of the AI kit, and she opens it. She then removes an instruction card and a cylindrical key.

As Brianna reads the instructions, she places the key in a slot at the front of the console and twists it clockwise. A five minute counter appears on the console and starts counting down.

BRIANNA
Five minutes?

OVERSIGHT
The time should be more than adequate.

Brianna looks at the card again, and starts to type in the code on the a holographic keyboard that floats just above the surface of the console.

EMBER ONE AI (O.S.)
Seed Number Accepted.

The console hologram displays: "AI Rating: 2.00"

BRIANNA
(to herself)
Okay, what's next.

The card reads: "Place the provided holodisk on the console."

She removes a small box from the case marked "holodisk" and notices it's too light. She opens the box, turns it upside down, and shakes it as if expecting something to fall out, but nothing happens.

BRIANNA
Where's the holodisk?
(beat)
Oooooooh, this is not happening...

OVERSIGHT
Didn't you inspect the kit beforehand?

BRIANNA
No.
(looks back at Oversight)
I don't suppose we could pause for a few minutes toooo...

Oversight give her an icy stare and says nothing.

BRIANNA
...I mean, can't we just reset and start over?


OVERSIGHT
You overheard my conversation with the Captain, did you not?

Brianna hesitates for a moment, then...

BRIANNA
Yes.

OVERSIGHT
Then you already know my answer, don't you?

Brianna nods. She gestures over the holoband on her wrist to bring up a holographic "Call List". She scrolls to Tokamak's name and presses it. A dialog window appears asking for confirmation. She hovers her trembling finger over "Yes" for a moment, then lowers her hand.

BRIANNA
Maybe I have a another option.

She makes a different gesture, and another window appears showing her photo albums. She touches her family album, then selects "Copy to Console" from a popup menu. A dialog asks her to confirm.

BRIANNA (CONT.)
What if I complete the initialization?

OVERSIGHT
The images from the holodisk are specifically calibrated to initialize the neural architecture for a Level 3 artificial intelligence. Achieving the same effect with random images would be nothing short of a miracle.

Brianna looks at both confirmation dialogs for a moment. She then cancels the call and copies the album to the console.

Spherical holographic thumbnails float over the console like bubbles. They snap into chronological order, and the first bubble opens into a larger hologram, revealing SERAPHINA JEMISON POLYWELL, a black woman of short but muscular stature wearing a hospital gown and holding BABY BRIANNA.

EMBER ONE AI (O.S.)
This is you?

BRIANNA
Hello there. Uh... Yes. That's me with my mother, Seraphina.

The AI Rating advances to 2.03.

The hologram collapses back into a bubble, and several other bubbles are opened and closed by the ship's AI in rapid succession. It finally stops on an image of AIDEN POLYWELL, a tall, waifish man with pale skin and dark hair, holding YOUNG BRIANNA, who clutches her new plush phoenix.

EMBER ONE AI (O.S.)
Who is this man?

BRIANNA
That's my father, Aiden Polywell.

EMBER ONE AI (O.S.)
The metadata on this hologram indicates that you are five years old, yet your father does not appear in any of the previous images.

BRIANNA
That was the first time I was ever with my father. He's lived his entire life in space, so he can't survive on the surface of Herculaneum. He had to wait until I was old enough to survive a trip into orbit.

AI Rating: 2.09

The AI scrolls through several more holograms. It stops on an image of Brianna with her parents on the observation deck of the Prodigal Sun, staring down at the Earth.

EMBER ONE AI (O.S.)
You've been on Earth?

BRIANNA
Well, no. We stayed on board the Prodigal Sun. I was too young to understand at the time, but I'd have to return to Herculaneum in a few weeks, or my muscles would atrophy and I'd never be able to return to the surface. Those weeks were the longest I've ever been with my father.

AI Rating: 2.12

Brianna looks at the counter: 1:02

The ship's AI burns through the rest of the holograms quickly, without asking any questions. Brianna fidgets nervously at the console.

Finally, the AI stops at the second to last hologram. The bubble expands to show an old, crumpled drawing in crayon. At the bottom of the drawing, two stick figures hold hands, the smaller one clutching a crude depiction of a plush phoenix. The two are labelled "Mom" and "Me".

In orbit, a small uncolored rectangle contains two more stick figures. The larger one is labelled "Dad", but the smaller one, clutching its own phoenix toy, is unlabelled.

BRIANNA
(to herself)
I'd forgot I scanned that in.

EMBER ONE AI (O.S.)
This document was recently scanned, but spectral analysis indicates that the scanned document is at least ten years older.

The hologram zooms in on the unlabelled stick figure.

EMBER ONE AI (O.S.)
Who does this figure represent?

BRIANNA
That's my brother.

The ship's AI scans the previous holograms in rapid succession, then returns to the hologram of the drawing.

EMBER ONE AI (O.S.)
There doesn't appear to be any other record of a brother.

BRIANNA
That's because I never really had one. I wished for one. I imagined what he'd be like. Every Christmas I would write Santa asking him to give me a brother. I imagined he would stay in orbit with my father, keeping him company while I was with my Mom on the surface. Then, one day, my mother and I would move to an orbital station and all four of us would live together.

Brianna brushes away a single tear.

BRIANNA (CONT.)
But my parents never gave me a brother. I guess they didn't want to put another child through what I went through.

The AI selects several holograms Brianna and her parents, visually indicating specific measurements and facial features. A window showing a DNA sequence appears.

EMBER ONE AI (O.S.)
Extrapolating most probable genome... Extrapolation complete. Constructing holographic matrix.

A small drone detaches from the top of the computer core and flies to a position near Brianna. The drone projects a holographic avatar.

Brianna reflexively puts her hands over her mouth. An exact recreation of the ten-year-old brother she never had stands before her.

AI Rating: 3.01

EMBER ONE AI
(in a normal child's voice)
Is this avatar not acceptable? I can select another one.

BRIANNA
No, it's fine. You--you just caught me off guard.

The clock reaches zero.

OVERSIGHT
Congratulations, Ms. Polywell.

The yellow glow from the crescent spreads into conduits that radiate invasively from the inner curve of the crescent into the AI computer core. The AI's avatar vanishes, and the drone that projected it returns to its perch.

BRIANNA
What happened?

OVERSIGHT
Nothing happened. The ship's AI isn't sanctioned to interact with anyone who isn't an official member of the crew. 

BRIANNA
But he's alright... Right?

OVERSIGHT
I suppose.

Brianna sighs with relief and smiles.

OVERSIGHT
Oh, so you think you've done a good thing here. Might I remind you that this ship is only sanctioned for a Level 3 artificial intelligence. Should he ever reach the next level, true sapience, I would have to immediately decommission him.
(steps in close)
You've created a child who will forever be a slave to the military and can never grow up.

Oversight steps back, watching Brianna's smile fade as what he said sinks in.

OVERSIGHT
Now, I'm afraid you only had clearance for this area while you were initializing the AI. I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

INT. SHIPYARD ENGINEERING OFFICE - DAY

BRIANNA
(indignant)
He kicked me out.

CASSIDY O'MALLEY QUAN and her husband, JASON QUAN, listen from their adjoining desks. Cassidy has hair so red one might think her scalp is ablaze, with a mischievous disposition to match. Her pregnancy is just beginning to show.

Jason is a seemingly quiet and easy-going Asian gentleman, the same age as his wife, whose calm features belie a similarly wicked disposition.

KATY PATEL hands them cups of coffee from a tray. She's petite, but strangely muscular, similar to Brianna. Her Sino-Indian features suggest she's not a pure Patel. She looks up at Brianna flashes an awkward smile. Brianna gives her the side-eye.

CASSIDY
Did everything go alright?

Brianna hesitates.

BRIANNA
(voice pitch up)
Uh... Yeah... Everything went fine.

CASSIDY
Then don't sweat it.

Katy gingerly offers Brianna a cup of coffee as a peace offering. Brianna's grin morphs into her best poker face. She glances sideways at the offering, dispassionately accepts it, and takes a long sip as Katy watches in agonizing anticipation.

BRIANNA
Thanks, Katy.

Katy exhales in relief, then takes the tray out of the room. Brianna watches her go, then sits down next to Jason and Cassidy.

BRIANNA
(softly)
So?

Cassidy calls up a holographic window displaying her and Jason's assignments and tilts it towards Brianna. 

CASSIDY
(more softly)
Just like we thought. Jason and I are handling supplies.

BRIANNA
(almost whispering)
That ought to make it real easy for you-know-what.

KATY (O.S.)
(normal volume, comparatively loud)
What?

CASSIDY
(startled)
Nothing.

KATY
Are you planning something?

CASSIDY
Even if we were, we wouldn't tell you, Katy.

KATY
Why not?

BRIANNA
'Cause you're a narc.

CASSIDY
Yeah, just look how quickly you flipped on Brianna this morning.

KATY
But I had tell Tokamak. It was an unauthorized EVA. She could have gotten hurt out there.

CASSIDY
Sorry, you broke the sacred girl code.

Katy leans over to Jason.

KATY
Jason, you're not bound by the girl code.

JASON
No way, Katy. Cassie would kill me.

KATY
Pleeeeeease? It's not like I don't know about that cool thing your planning.

JASON
Operation Last Hurrah?

Brianna and Cassidy simultaneously punch Jason in either shoulder.

JASON
(choking back the pain)
I guess I deserved that.

Brianna yawns.

JASON
We're you really out all night watching those drones finish the ship?

BRIANNA
Yeah. This coffee's the only thing keeping me going right now.

CASSIDY
Don't know why you bothered. The drones recorded the whole thing. You can watch it any time. There's already a Holo-GIF meme...

Cassidy displays a hologram of the last piece of the ship being welded into place. Giant letters appear above the ship: "DONE!"

BRIANNA
It's never the same as being there, though.

Brianna sets down an empty mug and yawns again.

BRIANNA
Anyway, my assignments's already done. I think I'll just hit the hay.

CASSIDY
Take care.

Brianna walks out.


INT. BRIANNA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Brianna, dressed in pajamas and clutching an old, battered phoenix plushy, hits her bed like a ton of bricks.

BRIANNA
Lights.

The lights dim.

FADE TO BLACK:

INT. EMBER ONE WINDOWED CORRIDOR - DAY

Brianna walks along a gradually curving corridor. The outside of the curve is lined with thick windows. Katy steps in from an intersecting corridor and walks with her.

KATY
You look exhausted. Did you get any sleep?

BRIANNA
A little.

KATY
Must be rough spending all night working on Operation Last Hurrah, huh?

BRIANNA
Nice try.

They reach an L-shaped junction, turn, then walk into a door marked "Bridge".

INT. EMBER ONE BRIDGE - DAY

The two enter the top of three descending tiers. The walls project holograms of the ship's surroundings, making each tier appear to float in space.

Captain Le Guin sits in a round balcony-like structure at the center, with a holographic wireframe of the *Ember One* projected from a table in front of them.

Tokamak monitors the engines from a console on the back. Katy joins him.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Take us out.

An officer wearing an opaque helmet, helm officer, sits in a chair with a glowing disc behind they're neck, a receiver for their wireless neural interface. It blinks as the *Ember One* moves away from the station and out into open space, indicating that the ship is acting under their control.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Let's put this FTL drive through its paces. Take us into a ten billion kilometer orbit at one thousand times the speed of light.

HELM
One thousand C. Aye, Captain.

The *Ember One* goes into FTL. Herculaneum flies off into the distance, and the system's dwarf star begins to slowly recede. Tiny streaks of light flash around them as particles is space are disrupted by the FTL drive.

TOKAMAK
All systems nominal.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Very well. Helm, accelerate to 4000 C.

The streaks intensify into ribbons of light. The ribbons begin to vibrate, and the ship starts to shudder. The area in front of the ship begins to glow and sparkle. TOKAMAK Ionized particles are accumulating off the bow of the ship. *Ember One*...

The AI's avatar appears in the form of Brianna's make-believe brother.

TOKAMAK
Recalibrate our FTL drives to reduce ionization off our bow.

EMBER ONE AI
(confused)
FTL? Bow? I don't--

TOKAMAK
Yes, reconfigure the FTL.

EMBER ONE AI
I don't understand.
(turns to Brianna)
Sister, what am I supposed to do.

TOKAMAK
Sister?

He looks at the AI avatar, then at Brianna.

TOKAMAK (CONT.)
Polywell, what have you done?

The ship shakes violently and begins to list to the side and downward. The ion buildup intensifies into a wave of energy that approaches the ship.

Brianna looks at the AI avatar, who is no longer a hologram, but a real boy.

EMBER ONE AI
Sister, what am I supposed to do?

The wave of energy rips open the bridge. Fire erupts throughout the room, then an instant later everything is sucked out the exposed front of the ship.

INT. BRIANNA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Brianna sits up in her bed. She looks around, calms herself, and drops back down with a loud THUD. She picks her holoband off the nightstand and taps it. It projects the time: 11:31 AM

Brianna glances over to Samantha's massive crate, which takes up almost half the room.

CUT TO:

INT. BRIANNA'S BATHROOM - DAY

Now fully dressed, Brianna brushes her teeth in front of a mirror. Her hair is combed, but damp. As she brushes with one hand, she wipes condensation from the mirror with the other. Finally, she takes a large sip from a cup, and spits into the sink.

A door chime rings in the other room. Brianna returns to...

INT. BRIANNA'S APARTMENT - DAY

BRIANNA
Door Open.

The door opens. It's Samantha.

SAMANTHA
Hey, I wanted to see if you're available for lunch--

She steps over the threshold and immediately falls to the floor.

SAMANTHA
(barely able to speak)
Gravity... Gravity...

BRIANNA
Oh, sorry.

Brianna rushes to a panel that reads "4.01 G". She presses a button and it quickly counts down to "1.00 G". She then helps Samantha to her feet.

SAMANTHA
Thanks.
(looking at the crate)
They wasted no time delivering my crate, I see.

BRIANNA
If you don't mind me asking, what've you got in that crete? Some kind of entertainment system?

Samantha beams a cheshire cat grin.

SAMANTHA
Open it.

!FROM INSIDE THE CRATE

Darkness gives way to light as Brianna opens the crate.

!BACK TO SCENE

Inside the crate is a frame with a negative space in the center shaped like a sphere. At the back of the sphere is an abstract depiction of Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man.

A headset and some kind of suit lay at the bottom.

Brianna picks up the headset.

BRIANNA
What is this, some kind of virtual reality rig?

SAMANTHA
It's a Type-3 neuro-immersive rig. Let's you dive into Neurospace without one of these...

She taps a small, disk-shaped bump at the base of her skull.

SAMANTHA
I used to use this rig when I was a kid, but like most of Venusians, I got an implant in my late teens, so I don't need it anymore.

Brianna sets the headset down and picks up the suit, dangling it in front of her.

SAMANTHA
Wanna give it a try?

!LATER

Brianna finishes zipping up the front of the suit. She presses a button, and the suit tightens around her body for a snug fit.

BRIANNA
Did I really need to be naked under the suit?

SAMANTHA
(glancing to the left)
Oh, yeah. It needs... uh... complete skin contact to interact with your nervous system.

Brianna steps inside the interior of the rig, and Samantha reaches to place the headset on her head.

!FROM BRIANNA'S POV

Samantha puts the headset on Brianna. Reality burns away like paper, revealing...

INT. SAMANTHA'S TREEHOUSE - DAY

Brianna stands in a large loft, decorated in a neo-fantasy style commonly seen in MMORPGs. She is wearing a simple white dress and shiny white boots.

As she looks around, small flaming hummingbirds fly from all directions to a central point in front of Brianna, forming a swirling vortex that contracts into a human form. The woman before Brianna has blood red hair, and wears an elaborate dress of red, black and gold. Her irises glow bright blue, and beneath her perfect makeup, we see a familiar face.

SAMANTHA
Do I know how to make an entrance, or what?

BRIANNA
Where are we?

SAMANTHA
This is my personal Neuroverse environment. Every user has one. Because you're using my old rig, it brought you to my environment, but I can help you build your own later.

Samantha guides Brianna to a dressing mirror.

SAMANTHA
This is your avatar. You can change how you look by simply looking into a mirror like this one and picturing how you'd like to look.

Brianna stares intently at her reflection. Her outfit in the mirror suddenly changes to a mechanic's overalls, utility belt and tank top. Brianna realizes her own clothes have changed and, startled, steps back from the mirror.

Samantha laughs.

Brianna regains her composure and steps back in front of the mirror. She touches her neck, and then suddenly a red scarf appears. This time she's unphased. SAMANTHA Looks like you're getting the hang of it. Don't worry about perfecting your avatar all in one go. I tweak mine constantly.

A crystal ball, set on a seance table nearby, begins to glow, and an aurora borealis encircles it. The distorted voice of BRUTALIA radiates from it.

BRUTALIA (O.S.)
Raven, where ya at? We've been waiting for ten minutes.

BRIANNA
Who's Raven?

SAMANTHA
That's my handle. Raven Nightfury.

Samantha extends her palm toward the crystal ball, and it flies into her hand. She holds it in front of her like a microphone.

SAMANTHA
Waiting where?

BRUTALIA (O.S.)
We're supposed to be doing the Eldritch Horror quest in Space Witches today. You forgot, didn't you?

Samantha glances to the left.

SAMANTHA
No. No. I was just seeing if my new friend Brianna wanted to join us.

Samantha gestures a plea to Brianna.

BRIANNA
Uh... Sure. I'd love to come.

INT. H.M.S. EXCALIBUR SUMMONING ROOM - DAY

Samantha and Brianna appear on summoning circles engraved on the metal floor. Brianna notices that their clothes are subtly different, matching the spaceship's Dieselpunk aesthetic.

Samantha gestures to a large spiral staircase encircling the room. They descend the staircase to...

INT. H.M.S. EXCALIBUR HANGER - DAY

BRUTALIA, LORD TENTAKEWL and JEFF are waiting.

SAMANTHA
Let me introduce you to Team Nightfury. This is Brutalia.

Brutalia is a seven-foot Amazon of a woman, clad in armor and black leather. She reaches to shake Brianna's hand, then pulls her in close.

BRUTALIA
(Under her breath)
Break her heart and I'll kill you.

BRIANNA
(Confused)
What?

BRUTALIA
Oh. Uh. Never mind.
(Pats Brianna on the shoulder)
Forget I said anything.

SAMANTHA
Are you giving her a hard time.

BRUTALIA
(avoiding eye contact)
No.

SAMANTHA
(to Brianna)
See, that's her tell. If she's lying, she never looks you in the eyes.

She turns to Lord Tentakewl, who looks like Slenderman in combat fatigues and wears a pair of dark goggles.

SAMANTHA
This is Tentakewl. I call him L.T. for short.

LORD TENTAKEWL
That's *Lord* Tentakewl...
(takes a bow)
...At your service.

SAMANTHA
His tell is that he wriggles his tentacles.

LORD TENTAKEWL
(holding still his wriggling tentacles)
No I don't.

BRIANNA
(whispering to Samantha)
Are there eyes under those goggles?

SAMANTHA
(whispering back)
Nobody knows.

LORD TENTAKEWL
I heard that.

Samantha turns to Jeff, an ordinary-looking gentleman in a plain brown suit.

SAMANTHA
And last but not least, this is Jeff.

JEFF
Hey.

SAMANTHA
Jeff's tell is that he never says more than one word unless he's lying.

JEFF
Utter nonsense.

LORD TENTAKEWL
How come she gets to know all our tells and we don't know hers?

SAMANTHA
Good point. Okay, Bree, we're going to have you play a quick game of "Two Truths and a Lie" to figure out your tell. Go ahead.

BRIANNA
Well... Okay. One, I'm a fan of ancient two-dimensional movies. Two, I can't stand the taste of mangos--

SAMANTHA
Really? Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

BRIANNA
And Three...
(voice pitched up)
...I lost my favorite plush toy when I was eight.

SAMANTHA
That last one's the lie.

BRIANNA
Is it that obvious?

SAMANTHA
I saw a plushy in your room. A phoenix, right? That, and your voice goes up when you lie.

BRIANNA
Oh. Okay. Well, what about you?

SAMANTHA
Huh?

BRIANNA
What's your tell? What do you do when you lie?

Samantha glances to the left.

SAMANTHA
I don't have a tell.
(puts her arm around Brianna)
Okay, now, be nice to Bree here. She's a Neurospace virgin, so I need you guys to help show her the ropes. She doesn't have any gear, so does anyone have a few items she can borrow?

Each team member brings up an inventory screen and selects an item to offer. An offer window appears to Brianna displaying four items:

Lord Tentakewl offers the Mirror of Truth, and ornate silver hand mirror.

Brutalia offers the Ocarina of Sorrow. It's carved from a blue, fossilized dragon egg and trimmed in silver.

Jeff offers Broom Prototype #47. It appears to be a simple black-lacquered broom.

Raven Nightfury offers Caladrius Armor, which rapidly heals the wearer, but offers little direct protection.

Brianna presses a button to accept all items. The armors immediately appears over her clothes, the ocarina hanging around her neck, the mirror tucked in her belt and the broom in her hand.

SAMANTHA
Okay, spells in Space Witches are basically just a matter of controlling your own thoughts and emotions. The system reads your brainwaves and determines what spell you're trying to cast. There's also stuff like potions and incantations, but we're going to start you off with the easiest spell in the game: the Broom Spell.

Brianna positions herself side-saddle on the broom.

SAMANTHA
Now basically you just imagine yourself flying around on the broom--

Brianna is flung wildly around the hanger, bouncing off the walls, ceiling and floor. Brutalia finally catches the back of the broom and Brianna goes tumbling off.

BRUTALIA
Careful, newbie. Don't wanna waste half your health cracking your skull open on the hanger floor.

SAMANTHA
You okay, Bree?

BRIANNA
I think so. Just a bit dizzy.

SAMANTHA
What were your thoughts when you were flying on your broom?

BRIANNA
I was just trying not to kill myself, but the more frightened I got, the more the thing threw me around.

SAMANTHA
Spells are fueled by your emotions. If you're afraid, the broom goes faster. It's feeding off of your apprehension. 

LORD TENTAKEWL
Tell you what, we're going on ahead. Why don't you guys practice a little more and catch up with us when you're ready.

Brutalia jams a large button near the hangar doors with her fist. A SIREN sounds to notify everyone that the hanger doors are about to open.

BRUTALIA
Hey newbie, hope you're ready for a baptism of fire.

SAMANTHA
You're not helping.

The launch door opens. The planet below looms large against the starry sky, but a barrier resembling the membrane of a soap bubble prevents the room from decompressing.

Lord Tentakewl, Brutalia and Jeff hop on their brooms and fly towards the barrier, forming bubbles around them as they pass through it.

Brianna stares at the planet, frozen in place.

SAMANTHA
What's wrong.

BRIANNA
I... I suppose this is a bad time to tell you I'm afraid of heights.

SAMANTHA
A superwoman like you is scared of heights?

BRIANNA
I grew up on Herculaneum, where the surface gravity is over four Gs. You know what happens when you trip on the stairs at four Gs? You die.

SAMANTHA
Don't worry. You're not going to fall. If you lose control, I'll be there to catch you.

She takes Brianna's hand.

SAMANTHA
Do you trust me?

Brianna pauses for a moment, then gives a quick nod.

Samantha puts Brianna's hand on the broom about a quarter from the top. Cradling Brianna from behind, she guides the other hand to the broom and positions the broom between Brianna's knees.

SAMANTHA
Okay, now don't think about making the broom fly. You don't control the broom, you control yourself. Just close your eyes and imagine you're floating under the ocean, like a jellyfish.

Brianna closes her eyes.

.IMAGINED ENDLESS OCEAN

Brianna floats alone in clear water, as if for an eternity, her body glowing in the darkness.

SAMANTHA (O.S.)
Open your eyes.

INT. H.M.S. EXCALIBUR HANGER - DAY

Brianna levitates several feet off the floor.

BRIANNA
Holy Mother of--I--I'm floating.

SAMANTHA
Now hold the broom firmly with your thighs and ankles.

Brianna obeys.

SAMANTHA
Good. Now just feel yourself floating slowly backwards.

Brianna tilts her broom slightly upward and slowly backs up.

SAMANTHA
Now forward.

Brianna tips slightly down and inches forward.

SAMANTHA
I think you're ready. Just imagine yourself shooting out of this hanger like a bullet from a gun.

Brianna takes a breath, then catapults forward through the barrier, a bubble forming around her.

EXT. ABOVE THE ELVEN PLANET - DAY

Samantha catches up to Brianna on her broom.

SAMANTHA
(as if in Brianna's mind)
You doing okay?

BRIANNA
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

Samantha cups her ears, then shakes her head.

SAMANTHA
(in Brianna's mind)
There's no air in space to conduct sound. You have to use telepathy?

BRIANNA
(using telepathy)
How do I do that.

Samantha smiles.

SAMANTHA (TELEPATHY)
You just did.

BRIANNA (TELEPATHY)
How long will it take us to reach the surface.

SAMANTHA (TELEPATHY)
A while if we don't pick up the pace. Want to make it a race.

BRIANNA (TELEPATHY)
Sure.

As they race towards the planet below, their bubbles glow red hot from friction with the atmosphere. The bubbles grow thinner, and look like they're about to pop.

BRIANNA (TELEPATHY)
Uh, are they supposed to do that.

SAMANTHA (TELEPATHY)
Don't worry about it. The bubbles are supposed to evaporate on atmospheric entry. It's kinda like a heat shield.

EXT. SKIES ABOVE THE ELVEN CAPITAL CITY - DAY

The bubbles burst, and in the distance, they see the rest of the team. Lord Tentakewl is taking point, looking downward with a pair of binoculars.

LORD TENTAKEWL
Took you gals long enough.

SAMANTHA
What have we got?

LORD TENTAKEWL
Dark Matter Elementals.

SAMANTHA
Diamond formation, Brianna in the center.

The team quickly forms around Brianna. Their wands appear magically into their hands. Brianna looks at her own hand. A small tattoo, made of a circle and other shapes and runes, becomes visible.

BRIANNA
Wand.

A beginner's wand, a simple trimmed branch, appears in her hand. Samantha watches with a slight, proud smile, then glances back to the approaching enemy.

Metal spheres whip their inky, liquid tendrils out at their party like stretchy whips. Jeff projects a spherical shield around the team, deflecting their attacks.

SAMANTHA
Aim for the metal. That's what allows them to interact with physical matter.

Samantha, Brutalia and Lord Tentakewl cast lightning spells, heating the metal spheres red hot, but failing to damage them.

LORD TENTAKEWL
It's not working.

BRUTALIA
He's right. We're burning through manna fast, and we're barely scratching in those things.

More dark matter tendrils strike the shield. Jeff is becoming visibly tired projecting the shield. Sweat beads on his forehead.

JEFF
Guys?

SAMANTHA
We need to redirect their tendrils back at them.

BRUTALIA
Mini portals?

SAMANTHA
That takes two people. I'll back you up. L.T., make sure to cover Bree and don't let her fall.

LORD TENTAKEWL
Roger! Roger!

A tendril from the closest elemental shoots out at the shield. Samantha uses her wand to create a dark flat circle in front of the shield. Brutalia creates a similar circle immediately in front of the elemental. The tendril enters the first hole and immediately shoots out of the second one, obliterating the elemental's own sphere. The tendril immediately recoils, but the dark matter is already fading away. The elemental vanishes.

SAMANTHA
It's working.

Samantha and Brutalia destroy several more elementals, but more join the fight. Several strike the shield at once, and it fails. The team momentarily scatters, and a tendril whips around the back of Brianna's broom, snapping it like a twig.

Lord Tentakewl dives after her. Using the tentacles on his back, he pulls two pistols and two machine guns from their holsters and uses them as covering fire to keep the elementals away.

In the background, Jeff gets the shield back up around the remaining three.

As Brianna screams for her life in free fall, rapidly approaching the ground, Lord Tentakewl twists and blazes through the elementals with the bravado of an action hero.

He readies his wand, and a twisty beam of energy shoots out and envelops Brianna. He pulls back on the wand like a fishing pole, slowing her descent until she stops with her feet inches above the ground. He releases the beam.

EXT. CAPITAL CITY RUINS - DAY

Brianna plants her feet on a cobblestone road, amid the ruins of a large city. She drops to her hands and knees and kisses the ground. She immediately regrets it, spitting and wiping her mouth.

LORD TENTAKEWL
How 'bout that flying, huh? They don't call me *Lord* Tentakewl for nothing.

While he hovers above, Samantha approaches on her broom.

LORD TENTAKEWL
Oh, hey Raven. You got here fast. I caught your girl for ya.

SAMANTHA
You were supposed to keep her from falling in the first place.

BRIANNA
It's okay. I'm fine.

SAMANTHA
Let me come down there and get you...

Samantha starts to fly towards Brianna, but Brutalia grabs the end of her broom to stop here.

SAMANTHA
What is it?

!BRUTALIA'S POV

Objects resembling ocean mines float in distorted space around Brianna, connected in a matrix together by thin black beams. They drift about slowly but continuously.

!BACK TO SCENE

BRUTALIA
She's stuck in an interdimensional minefield. I'm the only one of us who can see those things, so I'll lead her out.

Brutalia swings off her broom, placing it on her back as she falls, and a strap magically appears across her body to hold the broom, like a rifle sling. She makes a superhero landing next to Brianna.

BRUTALIA
Okay, just follow in my footsteps and you should be just fine.

Brutalia offers her hand, but Brianna hesitates. She steps closer to Brianna to speak privately.

BRUTALIA
Look, I admit it. I don't like you. But there's no way I'd let anything happen to you. Let's just say I owe Raven way too much. You understand?

Brianna nods and takes her hand. They begin walking through the mines and up a rubble-covered hillside. Occasionally, Brutalia ducks or dodges to the side to avoid a mine, and Brianna follows suit.

Half way out of the minefield, Brianna slips on some loose bricks. Brutalia keeps her from falling, but her body crosses one of the beams between two of the mines, which begin to emit a humming noise.

BRUTALIA
Get on my back, now.

Brianna jumps on her back, and Brutalia bolts up the hillside as mines begin to explode behind them.

EXT. BRICK ROADWAY - DAY

Reaching the top of the hill, Brutalia sets Brianna down. The rest of the team is waiting.

BRUTALIA
(breathing heavily)
I've rescued... our... bad luck charm.

Brianna shows Samantha her broom. The end has been snapped clean off.

SAMANTHA
Well, you're not going anywhere on that. I think we could all use a break from flying anyways. Jeff, can you summon us transport chopper?

Jeff produces a large piece of chalk and begins drawing a large summoning circle. Once finished, the tattoos on his hands begin to glow and change shape. He kneels down and claps both palms down on the ground within the circle.

Blue flames erupt from the drawn lines of the summoning circle. Jeff steps back from the circle and the flames spread until the entire circle is filled with blue light. A heavy transport helicopter rises up from the circle, and the flames recede.

A COPILOT runs out from the transport to greet them.

COPILOT
Everyone aboard. We've established a temporary base in the courtyard outside the palace. We believe an Eldritch Horror is somewhere inside.

INT. TROOP TRANSPORT - DAY

Team Nightfury files in. Lord Tentakewl takes a seat behind a large, mounted machine gun.

EXT. ABOVE ASHLON (CAPITAL CITY) - DAY

The transport flies over the hastily abandoned, ruined buildings. It approaches the base of an enormous castle with roads spiraling around the exterior. The transport flies upward, and we see a palace set atop the enormous castle.

EXT. PALACE COURTYARD - EARLY EVENING

As the transport sets down, the corpses of fallen soldiers can be seen surrounding a military tent. The site is littered with burn marks, small fires and splattered blood. A wind whistles through the holes in the tent.

As Team Nightfury jumps out of the transport to investigate, distortions appear in the air, and four-dimensional knots of red flame emerge from the distortions. One of them passes through the window of the helicopter and enters the body of the pilot.

The pilot explodes, which in turn detonates the fuel tanks of the helicopter. Team Nightfury is thrown to the ground by the blast.

Several of the four-dimensional entities enter some of the corpses. The bodies rise to their feet, their eyes glowing red. The muscles of the corpses expand as if on magical steroids, and their limbs elongate and split in two.

Lord Tentakewl brings out his guns and fires. The limbs of his targets fly off, but burn away in red flame, only to grow back on the bodies from which they were severed. He quickly runs out of ammo and reloads.

Jeff casts a shield, but the abominations phase right through it. He switches to an enormous sword and swings. Crescents of energy slam into the creatures, knocking them back, but they quickly get back up.

Brutalia punches the air, creating shockwaves that also drive the creatures back. Samantha complement with a freezing spell that momentarily stops the creatures until the red fire burns away the ice.

Despite their best efforts, the creatures grow nearer.

Suddenly, a particularly strong gust of wind raises the pitch of the whistling of the tent fabric. The monsters pause for a moment and shutter, but they resume their attack a moment later, when the wind dies down.

Brianna glances from the monsters to the tent and back. She takes hand of her Ocarina of Sorrow and plays a variety of notes, trying to find the right one. As she does, the monsters are nearly close enough to touch the members of Team Nightfury, who are now back-to-back.

Finally, Brianna finds the right note, and the monsters stop again, clutching their heads. Brianna takes a deep breath and plays one long, loud note, and the monsters explode into pyres of red flame, dying down until they are nothing more than black scorches on the stone beneath.

LORD TENTAKEWL
Did you do that?

BRIANNA
Yeah.

LORD TENTAKEWL
That was awesome.
(Gives Brianna a high five.)
Wasn't that awesome, guys?

JEFF
Yup.

Brutalia looks away.

BRUTALIA
Whatever.

SAMANTHA
Don't look so glum, Brute. She couldn't have done it without your Ocarina.

BRUTALIA
(sarcastic)
I feel so much better.

SAMANTHA
Good, then it's time to see what's inside that castle.

Team Nightfury starts walking toward the palace entrance, but Brianna remains stationary. Samantha notices and stops them.

SAMANTHA
What's wrong?

BRIANNA
You all look exhausted, and you've used up most of the--uh--What do you call it?

JEFF
Mana?

BRIANNA
That's it. Bottom line is, you're not in the best shape. How do know you can beat whatever's in there? You don't even know what it is.

SAMANTHA
There's only one way we can find the answers to those questions...
(points to the palace entrance)
...and that's in there. We may fail today, but we'll just come back stronger next time, over and over until we've won. Team Nightfury never backs out of a quest. Not ever. It's okay if you want to bow out today. We won't hold it against you. But everyone who's part of this team is going through that door.

BRIANNA
Then I guess...
(grins)
Last one in is a rotten egg?

Samantha smiles back, they both bolt toward the door. The rest of Team Nightfury follows suit.

INT. PALACE ENTRY HALL - DUSK

The team races through the enormous hallway with newfound energy. As the light of day fades, torches begin to spontaneously burn with an eerie blue flame, as if triggered by their presence. They reach the inner doorway at the end of the hall and burst through the two large doors.

INT. BOTTOMLESS ABYSS - NIGHT

As the team passes through the door, all but Brianna plummet into an endless pit, screaming until they disappear from sight and their voices fade into the depths below. The pit spans all but a few centimeters of the floor near the door. The three distant walls are too far away to be seen. Away from the nearest wall, there is only darkness.

Regaining her balance on the edge of the precipice, Brianna begins to turn to go back through the doors when they close behind her and vanish, leaving only a stonewall where the opening used to be.

Brianna flattens herself out against the wall in terror.

CUT TO:

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT

A vast hall, devoid of anyone but Team Nightfury, is filled with thousands of chairs, many overturned, and at the end is a beautifully decorated casket on a raised platform, surrounded by thousands of flowers, all dead. The team are staring at Brianna as she remains pressed in terror against the door.

BRUTALIA
What the hell's the matter with her?

SAMANTHA
It's the Eldritch Horror. It causes delusions. Alters your sense of reality. We must be close. It may even be in the room.

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT (JEFF)

Jeff approaches a large glass bowl of marbles on a high, skinny pedestal. He touches the bowl, and the pedestal falls over, smashing the glass bowl and sending marbles everywhere. He desperately tries to pick them all up.

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT

Jeff is running about trying to pick up non-existent objects off the floor.

SAMANTHA
We just lost Jeff too.

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT (LORD TENTAKEWL)

Lord Tentakewl notices his tentacles waving about. One tries to wrap itself around his neck, but he catches it. Two tentacles wrap themselves around his arms, and the last one successfully wraps around his neck and begins to strangle him.

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT (SAMANTHA)

Lord Tentakewl is choking and clutching the air in front of him, his neck bent back and his tentacles flailing frantically behind him.

SAMANTHA
We're the only ones left.

She looks at Brutalia. Brutalia smiles back in response, red flames burning in her eyes. Her skin begins to melt, as if made of wax. She summons her favorite sword to her hand and slashes at Samantha, who dodges.

In turn, Samantha summons her own sword to defend herself.

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT

Brutalia desperately deflects Samantha's swings and slashes with her sword. Above them, the Elven Crown Prince ALINAR FENREN is suspended from the umbilical attached directly to his heart. The other end of the umbilical leads to an enormous abomination growing on the ceiling.

BRUTALIA
Raven, stop it. Snap out of it. I can see it. It's here, above us.

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT (LORD TENTAKEWL)

Everyone stands talking to each other and ignoring Lord Tentakewl as his own tentacles slowly choke the life out of him.

LORD TENTAKEWL (TELEPATHY)
What the heck is wrong with you people? Help me.

INT. BOTTOMLESS ABYSS - NIGHT (BRIANNA)

BRIANNA (TELEPATHY)
Tentakewl? You're alive? How did you survive the fall?

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT (LORD TENTAKEWL)

LORD TENTAKEWL (TELEPATHY)
Fall? What fall?

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT (SAMANTHA)

SAMANTHA (TELEPATHY)
Bree. LT. What you're seeing is an illusion created in your mind by the Eldritch Horror. It's not real. You have to snap out of it and help me stop Brutalia. One of those things from the courtyard got into her and she's attacking me.

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT

BRUTALIA (TELEPATHY)
I'm not attacking you. You're attacking me. Just hold still for a moment and close your eyes.

Samantha stops and closes her eyes. Brutalia relaxes for an instant, but the Prince watching from above gestures to a rack of swords, and they fly through the are and encircle Brutalia.

BRUTALIA (TELEPATHY)
Change of plans. Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT (SAMANTHA)

Samantha opens her eyes to see that she's surrounded by dozens of monstrous versions of Brutalia, their swords ready. She summons a second sword to her left hand.

SAMANTHA (TELEPATHY)
How do I keep from hitting the real you?

BRUTALIA (TELEPATHY)
I don't know.

The Brutalia doppelgangers attack, and Samantha furiously defends herself the endless onslaught of blades.

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT

Brutalia defends herself from both the levitating swords and Samantha's own frantic attacks. They alternate between defending each other and fighting each other.

INT. BOTTOMLESS ABYSS - NIGHT (BRIANNA)

BRIANNA
There has to be something I can do.

She carefully takes the Mirror of Truth from her belt. She looks at herself in the mirror. Behind her in the reflection is the two doors she came in through. She sets the mirror down above the pit where the floor should be, and it simply floats there, held up by the real-but-unseen floor.

!CLOSE UP ON MIRROR

There is a spell engraved along the rim of the mirror, written using indecipherable runes.

!BACK TO SCENE

Brianna sighs with frustration, then has an idea.

BRIANNA
(gazing fiercely at the runes)
Read.

Voices can be heard whispering a spell as the various runes light up on the mirror. Brianna stretches her hands out towards the mirror and recites the spell.

The mirror rapidly expands until the reflective surface of the mirror forms a floor for the room. She gazes at the reflection and sees the real Grand Hall. She looks up, and suddenly she's in...

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT

The reflective surface of the Mirror of Truth continues to take up the entire floor. Jeff, having been preoccupied with the illusion of marbles on the floor, immediately gets up.

BRIANNA (TELEPATHY)
Everyone look at the floor.

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT (LORD TENTAKEWL)

Lord Tentakewl struggles against his tentacles to look down a the floor. In his reflection, the tentacles wave freely behind him. Suddenly, the tentacles are back under his control. They immediately straighten his uniform and give him a gentle pat on the head.

LORD TENTAKEWL
Oh, so you're my buddies now? Don't think I'll forget your betrayal.

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT (SAMANTHA)

Samantha pushes back with both swords against two Brutalia doppelgangers, and is down on one knee. She looks down to see her reflection to see that she's fending off two floating swords. Her swords glow, and a burst of magic knocks the two swords back.

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT

Samantha runs toward the real Brutalia. Brutalia prepares to confront her, when Samantha comes within feet of her and then turns her back to her. Understanding, Brutalia immediately goes back-to-back with her and they fight off the swords together.

A crescent of energy drives back some of the swords and clears a path. Jeff runs in to join them.

Lord Tentakewl summons swords for each hand and tentacle, and furiously deflects sword attacks until he too has joined them.

Brianna takes the broom off its sling and uses it as a bo staff, knocking the swords aside. The swords dive towards her feet, and she pole vaults over them, dropping the broom and rolling into the center of the team, who close ranks around her.

SAMANTHA
So the Eldritch Horror has attached itself to the Prince, Alinar Fenren?

BRUTALIA
Yes, it's feeding off his energy, but that shouldn't be possible for a member of the royal bloodline.

LORD TENTAKEWL
No problem, we just sever the umbilical. Not even a demon god can stop this team.

Suddenly, the blades sweep upward and circle down towards the center of the team. The team is driven apart, dodging out of the way. All except for Brianna, who is impaled by a half dozen swords.

!BRIANNA'S POV

Samantha rushes up and pulls out some of the swords. She cradles Brianna's head. Blood pours out of the wounds.

SAMANTHA
Stay with me, Bree.

Brianna's vision begins to dim.

BRIANNA (V.O.)
This feels so real. Can you really die... in a game...

Everything goes black. The voices of the team grow faint.

SAMANTHA
Stay with me...

INT. TWILIGHT REALM

Brianna stands in endless darkness. At first, nothing else is visible, but after a moment, she sees a man facing away from her.

As she approaches the man, he turns to reveal that he is the deceased elven king, KING VOLODAR.

BRIANNA
Where am I?

KING VOLODAR
The Twilight. This is where the dead wait for entry into the afterlife. What is your name, young lady?

BRIANNA
Brianna. Brianna Polywell.

KING VOLODAR
A pleasure to meet you. I am KING VOLODAR Fenren III, former ruler of Ljosalfheim.

BRIANNA
You're the prince's father.

KING VOLODAR
Yes, much to my shame.

BRIANNA
You're disappointed?

KING VOLODAR
Only in myself. My son idolized me, but because I never made the time to be a real father, he knows me only by the myth I cultivated with my subjects and not the flawed man I truly am. I was once an aimless youth like him. When I insisted that he take a commission in the Army to straighten him out, I never told him that my father had done the same for me. I never got the chance to tell him how proud of him I really was. Whenever he would return home, however briefly, he spent more time in taverns with his men than he did with his family. How can I blame him? He thought I saw him as a failure.

In the distance, Brianna hears a voice.

KING VOLODAR (CONT.)
And now my pride has driven him into the embrace of a parasite offering to take away his pain.

A voice suddenly echoes through the Twilight.

SAMANTHA (O.S.)
Stay with me, Bree. Stay with me.

BRIANNA
What was that?

KING VOLODAR
It would appear your time in the land of the living is not yet at an end, Lady Polywell.

BRIANNA
(extending her hand)
Come with me. Back to the land of the living. Let's save your son together.

KING VOLODAR
(chuckling)
I assure you, I've been dead for far too long.

BRIANNA
Then take possession. Allow your spirit to guide me.

As a blinding light washes over Brianna, the King takes her hand and she embraces him.

INT. GRAND HALL - NIGHT

Samantha is aghast. Brianna is wearing the royal robes and crown atop her now elven ears. She stands up and takes hold of the Ocarina of Sorrow. She plays an ancient lullaby, her fingers dancing over the holes of the ocarina.

Prince Alinar's immediately snaps to attention. The swords fall to the ground as the lullaby continues to play. The Prince slowly descends to the floor as the Horror's umbilical pulls in vain against him.

Portals appear. From them spring dozens of horrific creatures of every imaginable shape and size.

SAMANTHA
(to Brianna)
We'll handle the monsters. You have to get through to the Prince. As long as he's feeding that thing his power, the Eldritch Horror can keep opening portals.

The prince approaches Brianna as she plays the final notes of the lullaby. Upon finishing, her kingly robes and other elven trappings fade away.

ALINAR
Who are you? How is it you know the lullaby my father played me as a child?

BRIANNA
Your father sent me here to help you, to free you from a monster who has taken hold of your heart. He wishes he could be here himself--

ALINAR
You speak in riddles.
(gesturing to the Eldritch Horror)
My father, the King, is right here.

ELDRITCH HORROR
(in the King's voice, distorted)
Heed not the words of this vile witch. She has come here to murder me, to end my rule as King.

BRIANNA
That's not the King. He's poisoned your mind. If you'll just look at him in the mirror's reflection below your feet--

ALINAR
Your tricks will not deceive me. No conjured mirror will make me abandon my father and King.

BRIANNA
Your father lies dead in that casket. You know this. You are here at his wake. Please, you'll see the truth if you just gaze down into the mirror.

The Prince notices the casket, but looks away.

ALINAR
I won't look. I don't need to. My King--my father cannot die.
(Eyes welling up with tears.)
He can't.

More portals open. Monsters spew out of them by the dozens.

SAMANTHA
Okay, guys, it's time to bring your A-game.

Samantha summons a huge, two-handed sword. Lightning sparks across the sword, and when she strikes one of the monsters, the lightning spreads to the nearby monsters, vaporizing all of them.

Brutalia summons a flaming battle axe. The ax slices through several monsters, setting their severed parts ablaze and reducing them to ash. She presses a button, and the axe head becomes the head of a mace, which she uses to incinerator every nearby monster around her.

Jeff switches to two seemingly ordinary katanas. He runs at impossible speeds through a crowd of monsters, slashing at them too quickly for the eye to see. The creatures pause for a moment, then fall to tiny pieces on the floor.

SAMANTHA
LT, bring out Big Bertha.

LORD TENTAKEWL
Are you sure? You told me that thing was a cheat.

SAMANTHA
If ever you wanted to cheat, now's the time.

Lord Tentakewl summons an enormous mini-gun, which he can only hold with the aid of all his tentacles. He laughs maniacal as his hail of gunfire rips through the monsters like toilet paper.

SAMANTHA
Brianna, you don't have time to be gentle. Rip the band-aid off already.

BRIANNA
I'm sorry for this...

She walks over to the casket and lifts the lid to reveal the King's lifeless corpse.

ALINAR
He's... He's just... sleeping...

Brianna takes his hands and looks into his eyes.

BRIANNA
I know how you feel. You never spend as much time as you want with your father, and then one day you find that the two of you are strangers. You try to talk to each other, but the child he once knew is gone and the hero you remember from childhood bears no resemblance to the stranger he's become. Then the day comes when it's too late to reconcile, and the myth of the man you could never measure up to is all you have left.

The Prince gazes down at his father's corpse.

ALINAR
What if you never had to feel that?

BRIANNA
Then that would be the greatest tragedy, because if I felt nothing--nothing at all--then his life would mean nothing to me. Loss and grief are part of love.

Millipede vines that radiate out of the umbilical into the the Prince's flesh begin to recede, but they begin to resist.

ALINAR
I'm not strong enough. Not like him. He was a rock. He held this kingdom together through sheer force of will. I was always the disappointment, the pretender, the spoiled child who would be king.

BRIANNA
You're not the only one with a legacy to live up to. My parents are geniuses, revered by everyone I know. I'll never know if I can live up to their example, but I'm still proud to be their child. I refuse to be afraid. I would never dishonor their legacy by running away from it.

The Prince steps away from his father, and looks down at the Mirror of Truth. His face contorts in disgust, and he grabs the umbilical with both hands. With all his might, he rips the umbilical from his chest. Flames shoot out from his heart, and the wound seals up almost instantly.

The Eldritch Horror screams in pain, and the portals evaporate. Team Nightfury quickly dispatch the remaining monsters. The horror turns into a chimera, dropping into the center of the room and scattering the team.

The chimera charges at Brianna, but the Prince draws his own sword and steps in front of her. The blade glows like the Sun. The Prince, without taking a step, cleaves its heads off with a single expert stroke.

The chimera rears back, but the rest of Team Nightfury are upon him. Bits of the creature are quickly hacked off and turn to dust.

Finally, only a single lump of sludge is left of the Eldritch Horror.

!ELDRITCH HORROR'S POV

The Prince, Brianna and the rest of Team Nightfury tower above, each with a melee weapon drawn. Together, they all stab the horror in unison.

CUT TO BLACK

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY

Team Nightfury, dressed in stately garb, stand in attendance as the Prince is coronated. Upon completion of the ceremony, the new King Alinar steps down from the throne and walks over to the team.

ALINAR
For the bravery you have shown in coming to my aid, I don't know how I can possibly thank you.

Samantha pretends to ponder the conundrum.

SAMANTHA
Hmm. Well, Your Highness, I guess money's always good.

ALINAR
(smiling)
Of course. You may have your weight in gold if you wish.

The new King then approaches Brianna and takes her hand.

ALINAR
I can never forget your kindness in particular. As a king, I am expected to marry and produce an heir, and I can think of no better wife than the woman who embodies the very spirit of my ancestors. If you would stay with me, I would give you a life of endless luxury and wonders beyond imagination.

BRUTALIA
(gnawing on a turkey leg)
You should listen to him. Being a queen can be a pretty sweetheart deal. All the best gear. Great food. Living in the lap of luxury for the rest of your life.

SAMANTHA
Of course, you would have to stay here with the King. You wouldn't be able to go with us on missions. I suppose we could visit. On occasion.

Brianna tilts her head down for a moment, then looks up at King Alinar with a gentle expression.

BRIANNA
King Alinar, I'm sorry, but I must decline your most generous proposal. My place is with my friends.

ALINAR
I understand, and I respect your decision. However, know that when you leave, you will take a part of my heart with you, and that is a wound time may never heal.

He kisses Brianna's hand.

ALINAR (CONT.)
No doubt your adventures will be filled with peril. Allow me to give you something that will aid in your journeys.

The King gives Brianna a silver wand of elven design. It glows a brilliant blue in her hands.

ALINAR (CONT.)
This wand has been in my family for ten generations. As a family of swordsmen, my family has little use for the tools of spell casting. Perhaps it would be put to better use in the hands of a good witch such as yourself.

BRIANNA
You are too kind, Your Highness.

ALINAR
(to the team)
You are forever welcome in my kingdom. Good luck and godspeed to you all.

EXT. PALACE COURTYARD - DAY

The team emerges from the palace. Servants attend to repairs for the palace and surrounding grounds.

SAMANTHA
You know...
(glances to the left)
...our team has a little tradition. Whenever a new member joins the team, we get to decide what their team name will be.

LORD TENTAKEWL
Since when?

Brutalia gives him a sharp elbow to the ribs and he yelps in pain. She then looks away from Brianna.

BRUTALIA
Yeah, we do have that tradition.

BRIANNA
So, Jeff, let me get this straight. When you joined the team, they named you "Jeff"?

JEFF
Of course.

BRUTALIA
Say, I've got an idea. In honor of how she crushed poor King Alinar's heart, I say we call her "Heartbreaker".

LORD TENTAKEWL
Why can't I be "Heartbreaker"?

BRUTALIA
Because then you couldn't be *Lord* Tentakewl.

SAMANTHA
'Heartbreaker', huh? I like it. Is that alright with you Jeff.

JEFF
Sure.

SAMANTHA
Then Heartbreaker it is.

BRIANNA
Don't I get a say in this.

BRUTALIA
Sorry, Heartbreaker. You can't fight tradition.

Brianna's neglected stomach lets out a loud grumble.

BRIANNA
Hey Raven, I think we forgot something.

Samantha looks confused for a moment, then her own stomach grumbles.

SAMANTHA
Oh. Right.

INT. BRIANNA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Samantha's implant stops glowing, and she looks up as Brianna removes her headset.

BRIANNA
Let's go eat.

Samantha gestures to stop her.

SAMANTHA
Whoa, hold on there. You can't go to lunch wearing that. 

BRIANNA
Oh, you're right. Give me a moment to change.

Brianna starts to unzip the suit.

SLOW ZOOM ON SAMANTHA  

As Brianna goes out of frame, a devious smile slowly creeps onto Samantha's lips as she watches Brianna.

EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY

At first, the *Ember One* is bathed only in the glow of Herculaneum's red dwarf. Lights turn on in the windows of the ship, then flood lights from the shipyard illuminate the ship's exterior.

INT. EMBER ONE WINDOWED CORRIDOR - DAY

Brianna walks along a corridor with a gradual curve. The outside of the curve is lined with thick windows. Noah steps in from an intersecting corridor and walks with her.

BRIANNA
Oh, hey Noah.

Brianna brushes the hair back over her ear.

BRIANNA (CONT.)
How'd it go with that parasitic DNA upgrade on those power control biochips? I'm so sorry you got stuck with that.

She puts her hand on Noah's shoulder. He blushes slightly.

NOAH
It was no problem. I learned a lot. It may be a little repetitive, but I enjoy that sort of thing sometimes.

BRIANNA
Are you excited about today's test?

NOAH
We needn't fear. We've done everything we can, and now we just have to put the rest in the Lord's hands.

BRIANNA
(smiling awkwardly)
Yeah. I suppose you're right.

They reach an L-shaped junction, turn, then walk into...

INT. EMBER ONE BRIDGE - DAY

The front blast doors are open, revealing a view of the shipyard, but the holographic walls are turned off, showing only a flat geometric pattern. Tokamak and Oversight are already standing at consoles at the rear of the bridge. Noah joins them. The Captain notices Brianna entering the room and sets down a china tea cup.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Good morning, Miss Polywell. It's good to finally meet you officially.

Brianna blushes.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Your file says that your parents led the team that designed and constructed the Prodigal Sun. Is that why the *Ember One*'s has such a unique FTL design?

TOKAMAK
Uh... My... entire team contributed to the design of all this ship's systems, including propulsion.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Of course.
(to Brianna)
How'd it go with the ship's AI?

BRIANNA
(pitching her voice up)
No problem.
(normal voice, still nervous)
I didn't get the opportunity to run any tests afterward, but--

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
(glancing at Oversight)
Yes, I know how that can be. Oversight, grant her all necessary access to the ship's AI.

OVERSIGHT
With all do respect, she's not yet an official member of the engineering crew--

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
For the purpose of these tests, I think we can skip the formalities.

OVERSIGHT
Very well.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
*Ember One*, display avatar.

The AI avatar appears, in form of Brianna's imaginary brother. The Captain observes the avatar with curiosity.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
He kind of looks like you, Miss Polywell.

Tokamak eyes Brianna suspiciously.

BRIANNA
Yeah, I think he might have used me as an initial template for his avatar.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Why did he choose the appearance of a child, though?

EMBER ONE AI
I can update my avatar with an older appearance if you'd like, Captain.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
That won't be necessary. Display a systems schematic.

EMBER ONE AI
Aye, Captain.

A hologram of the ship's systems appears from a central projector in front of the Captain's chair.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Run through a basic systems check.

As the AI runs through each system, they are displayed on the holographic schematic of the ship.

EMBER ONE AI
Aye, Captain. Fusion reactors are nominal. Schwarzschild Kugelblitz reactor is nominal. Batteries are nominal. Life support is nominal. Artificial Gravity is nominal. Thrusters are nominal. Metallic Hydrogen storage is at full capacity. FTL and sublight engines are nominal. Plasma shields are nominal. Plasma storage is at full capacity. No installed weapon systems detected. Access to communications is restricted by Oversight.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Give me an estimate on the time it will take to execute our flight plan. Are we on schedule?

EMBER ONE AI
Estimated time is two hours and thirty seven minutes. We are well within our three hour window, Captain.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Everything would appear to be in order with our ship's AI. Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Tokamak?

TOKAMAK
(slightly puzzled)
Yes...
(more authoritative)
Yes, Captain. Everything's in order.

Tokamak turns to Brianna.

TOKAMAK
Miss Polywell, have the AI run a simulation using the latest FTL field formulas and check for any anomalies. I don't want any surprises.

BRIANNA
Yes, sir.

As Brianna moves to one of the rear stations, the AI's holographic avatar reappears at her side.

BRIANNA
So, um, do you understand what's happening today?

EMBER ONE AI
We have extensive propulsion testing scheduled. The Helm Officer will test the sublight propulsion, then perform a fifteen-minute-long FTL endurance run at maximum cruising velocity. During that time, I will be collecting data and adjusting the power distribution and calibration of the FTL engines.

BRIANNA
That was... very well put. How is it you know all this without anyone telling you?

EMBER ONE AI
Your initialization input is not the only data I have access to. I have full access to all information regarding this ship's mission, design and operation.

BRIANNA
(nodding)
Of course.

EMBER ONE AI
Besides, there's little reason for concern, given the circumstances.

BRIANNA
Pardon?

EMBER ONE AI
Well, the purported purpose of the Exploration and Defense Initiative is as a pilot program for a unified, federalized military for the Alliance.
(beat)
However, it is improbable that such an organization will last, given the political pressure of dominant member states with their own formidable military forces. It's more likely that the program is intended to give smaller worlds leverage in negotiating defense treaties with the Earth Union or the various hypercorperations that make up the Dispute Resolution Council.

BRIANNA
So that's what you think the Initiative is, just a political power play by the small fry to negotiate better deals with the major players?

EMBER ONE AI
Well, I suppose it's a bit of an oversimplification of political dynamics within the Alliance, but that's my basic assessment.

Brianna looks away for a moment, balling her fists.

EMBER ONE AI
You appear distraught. Did I err in my reasoning regarding the Initiative?

BRIANNA
You really have no idea what the Initiative means to everyone here. Vessels like this will become a microcosm of the Alliance itself. Crew from all across the Alliance -- from every imaginable society, ideology and way of life -- will be part of a single organization, working together for a common purpose and for the benefit of all.

EMBER ONE AI
So this vessel is intended as a symbol of collectivism?

BRIANNA
It's a symbol of ***unity***.

The holographic avatar appears lost in thought for a moment. Then...

EMBER ONE AI
Thank you. I find your perspective quite fascinating. I'll need time to reflect on this.

A LIEUTENANT enters the bridge wearing a old, dull Earth Defense Forces uniform and a helmet, obscuring her face. Captain Le Guin glances back to see who it is.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Lieutenant, you do realize we no longer work for the Earth Defense Forces.

LIEUTENANT
None of the spare uniforms would fit me.

The lieutenant walks down to the pilot's seat at the center of the lowest tier of the bridge.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Perhaps you shouldn't have missed the fitting then.

The Lieutenant presses a button on her collar, and the helmet opens up and folds into it, revealing that the Lieutenant is actually Samantha Strata.

SAMANTHA
I was busy.

She looks up at Brianna and gives her a wink, then sits down in the pilot's seat. Her implant activates. Elements in the chair light up in response to her input.

The flat, geometric panels of the walls melt away into a breathtaking view of the station.

INT. VIRTUAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT - HELM

A virtual representation of Samantha, perfectly groomed and wearing an unrealistic flight suit, floats within a transparent representation of the ship. Umbilical cables and gangways connect to the transparent vessel.

Samantha makes a gesture, and a list of programs appears. Samantha selects one named KARASU, and a Chibi version of her alter ego, Raven Nightfury, appears.

SAMANTHA
Karasuchan, reset my flight configuration. We'll be starting from scratch.

KARASU
Default configuration loaded for Helm Control.

SAMANTHA
Begin the departure sequence.

EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY

KARASU (O.S.)
Retracting gangways.

The gangway doors close and the gangway retracts from the ship.

KARASU (O.S.)
Disconnecting umbilicals.

Umbilical cables disconnect from the ship and their armatures retract towards the station. The *Ember One* floats freely.

INT. EMBER ONE BRIDGE - DAY

KARASU (INTERCOM)
Sequence complete. Station security has cleared us for departure.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Lieutenant, take us out.

EXT. SHIPYARD

The forward-facing engines at the front of each nacelles emit a brief burst of thrust. The *Ember One* drifts backwards under its own inertia and leaves the shipyard.

When the ship is finally clear, there is a similar burst emitted by the rear-facing engines, bringing the ship to a halt.

INT. EMBER ONE BRIDGE - DAY

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Bring us about.

EXT. ORBIT ABOVE HERCULANEUM

The forward-facing engines on the left nacelles and the rear-facing engines on the right nacelles simultaneously emit a burst of thrust. The *Ember One* quickly spins to the left, until its angular momentum is cancelled by a mirror image of the initial engine thrust.

INT. VIRTUAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT - HELM

CAPTAIN LE GUIN (INTERCOM)
Lieutenant, some of us would like to keep our breakfast.

SAMANTHA
Sorry about that. This thing turns quick for a capital ship. Karasuchan?

KARASU
Gravity control algorithm corrected.

INT. EMBER ONE BRIDGE - DAY

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
*Ember One*, Display our scheduled flight path.

A graphical ribbon is projected over the holographic view of space. It gives a wide berth to a field of asteroids being mined in orbit, which is labelled "Parking Lot". The Captain stares at the asteroid field and smiles.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Ready to have some fun, Lieutenant?

SAMANTHA (INTERCOM)
I thought you'd never ask.

The Captain picks up their tea and begins to take a sip.

EXT. ORBIT ABOVE HERCULANEUM

The ship heads toward the asteroid field at alarming speed. It quickly maneuvers around one asteroid after another.

INT. EMBER ONE BRIDGE - DAY

Brianna is seated, gripping her chair in mortal terror. As holographic asteroids hurtle by all around her, she fumbles with the restraining harness. Noah, seeing her distress, gets out of his seat and helps her with the harness, then returns to his seat without putting on his own harness.

Brianna notices Tokamak securing his own harness.

The Captain, unphased, crosses their legs and takes another sip of tea.

INT. VIRTUAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT - HELM

The *Ember One* whips around a large asteroid to come face-to-face with several smaller vessels towing ore away from the asteroid. Samantha weaves and dodges, and the ship fires thrusters to follow suit, mirroring her movements.

INT. EMBER ONE BRIDGE - DAY

The Captain lowers their cup for a second.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
You're cutting it a bit close, Lieutenant.

They pour some more tea from an ornate teapot into the cup, sweetening it with a sugar cube.

SAMANTHA (INTERCOM)
I could have cut it even closer if I wanted to. This thing handles like a ship half its size.

EXT. SPACE

The *Ember One* leaves the asteroid field as Herculaneum grows smaller in the distance.

INT. EMBER ONE BRIDGE - DAY

Samantha steers the ship back to the graphical ribbon indicating its course.

SAMANTHA (INTERCOM)
We are clear of the Parking Lot.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Playtime's over. Let's begin primary FTL testing. Put us into a ten billion kilometer orbit around the star system at one thousand times light speed.

SAMANTHA (INTERCOM)
One Thousand C. Aye, Cap.

EXT. SPACE

The *Ember One* enters FTL. Herculaneum flies off into the distance, and the system's dwarf star begins to recede, but the other stars barely move. Tiny streaks of light flash around them as particles is space are disrupted by the FTL drive.

INT. EMBER ONE BRIDGE - DAY

TOKAMAK
All systems nominal.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Very well. Helm, take us to four thousand C.

SAMANTHA (INTERCOM)
Aye, Cap. Four thousand C.

A slight aurora appears off the bow of the ship.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
*Ember One*, give me a fifteen minute counter.

A red holographic clock counting up from "0:00" appears above the front window.

EMBER ONE AI
(to Brianna)
What's the counter for?

BRIANNA
Superstition. No vessel has ever successfully travelled at four thousand times the speed of light for more than fifteen minutes. Some don't even think it's possible.

EMBER ONE AI
Is this idea based on a law of physics I'm not aware of?

BRIANNA
Not exactly. When your FTL field is misconfigured, you can build up charged particles in front of the ship at high velocities. Sorta like breaking the sound barrier. Proper configuration of your FTL field can mitigate this or even eliminate it.

EMBER ONE AI
Understood. Thank you.

CLOSE UP on the countdown.

FADE TO:

The countdown clock reads "12:01".

The auroras grow thicker and brighter. The edges of the auroras begin to vibrate and blur, and the *Ember One* starts to shudder. Plasma shields automatically activate in front of the ship, and it begins to glow and sparkle as it absorbs stray ions that get too close to the ship.

EMBER ONE AI
Ionized particles are accumulating off the ship's bow. I've activated the forward plasma shields to compensate.

TOKAMAK
Brianna, reconfigure the FTL drive to disperse the ionized particles.

Brianna starts making adjustments to the FTL at her holographic console, but the ship continues to shudder and the density of the particles hitting the shields increases.

BRIANNA
Why isn't this working? It's like everything I try just makes it worse.

EMBER ONE AI
Your adjustments aren't behaving according to any of the established predictive models. Performing an active scan of the engines...

A schematic of the engine nacelles shows several drive elements in red.

EMBER ONE AI
Several of the drive elements have minute discrepancies that, although not detectable to the human eye, significantly alter the characteristics of the drive system. Our predictive models are useless in these conditions.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
*Ember One*, Sound general quarters.

An alarm sounds. Large blast doors close over the front window. A separate internal set of doors close inside the window and project a hologram, completing the wrap-around holographic display.

INT. LARGE CONVEYOR SHAFT

The bridge module slides quickly backward in a large shaft, then drops down a second shaft for a couple of decks before coming to a halt.

INT. EMBER ONE BRIDGE - DAY

BRIANNA
Captain, we have to drop out of FTL.

TOKAMAK
We can't. Our FTL field is partially protecting us from the ionized particles. If we shutdown the FTL engine now, we'll sustain heavy damage to the bow of the ship. The Captain won't take us out of FTL unless absolutely necessary.

BRIANNA
Without a predictive model for the ship to make adjustments, I'd have to make adjustments manually. There are thousands of possible variables, and there isn't enough time to run a simulation.

SAMANTHA
Let me try.

BRIANNA
You don't have the proper background in superluminal physics...

SAMANTHA
I may not understand the physics, but I have years of experience at the helm of large vessels like this one, and I know what a stable FTL field looks like.

Brianna looks at Samantha, unsure.

SAMANTHA
Do you trust me?

Brianna pauses for a brief moment, then transfers control to Samantha.

INT. VIRTUAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT - HELM

An overlay of the FTL field appears around the transparent projection of the ship that surrounds Samantha. She begins adjusting the FTL field.

SAMANTHA
Karasuchan, I'm going to need you to generate a neural algorithm based on my adjustments to the FTL field.

KARASU
Affirmative.

SAMANTHA
You know what, Bree, this whole situation reminds me of something that happened to my father a long time ago. He had just bought this antique, mint-condition autoclave, with beautiful, shiny racks made of real stainless steel.

The field constantly changes as Samantha concentrates to hold back the ionized particles. It's a stalemate.

SAMANTHA (CONT.)
He tried it out by thermally treating some titanium parts, but when he opened up the autoclave, the parts had melted wherever they touched the steel racks.
(beat)
Okay, Karasuchan, take over. *Ember One*.

The AI materializes at her side. His avatar appears solid in the virtual environment.

SAMANTHA
I need a list of all stable FTL configurations that were modelled and simulated in preparation for this test. Exclude configurations with greater than 85% efficiency.

EMBER ONE AI
Exclude them?

SAMANTHA
Yes, and present the remaining configurations visually using a genetic selection interface.

A set of nine 3D representations of FTL fields appear in front of her. She selects one. The rest disappear, the selected one moves to the center, and eight similar FTL field configurations appear around it. She repeats this process in rapid succession.

SAMANTHA
Where was I, Bree? Ah yes. The parts melted because they formed an alloy wherever the titanium and the steel made contact, and that alloy had a lower melting temperature than either metal. So to fix the problem, my father had to scratch up his precious shiny racks until they were coated in rust.

She selects and holds on a specific configuration. Both the current and the selected configuration appear on either side of the representation of the ship, along with a slider control.

SAMANTHA
We always want things to be perfect, but sometimes, to get something to work, you have to make it a little...
(moves the slider)
...imperfect.

The FTL field morphs incrementally towards the suboptimal configuration. At a third of the way between, the *Ember One* begins to vibrate, but Samantha pushes just beyond.

EXT. SPACE

The aurora flows from the front of the ship around to the back, where it forms a shimmering blue plume. The forward plasma screens deactivate.

INT. EMBER ONE BRIDGE - DAY

EMBER ONE AI
Ion concentrations ahead of the ship are back to normal. Engine efficiency has been reduced by five percent, but current reactor power is sufficient to maintain our velocity.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Damage Report.

EMBER ONE AI
No damage detected. Shield plasma reserves are at eighty two percent.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Cancel general quarters.

!LATER

The blast doors open up to reveal a view of space through the front window.

A chime sounds as the clock reaches "15:00" and turns green, continuing to count up.

The Captain turns to Tokamak.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
It was touch-and-go for a bit, but overall, I'd call that a successful test. Mr. Tokamak, can you be ready to leave for Earth in 48 hours?

TOKAMAK
Yes, Captain.

EMBER ONE AI
AI Captain, may I ask a question?

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Go ahead.

EMBER ONE AI
Why am I named "Ember One"?

TOKAMAK
It's the code name under which you were constructed. Technically, you don't have a name until the Captain selects one for you.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Given your performance today, perhaps you've earned the right to name yourself. What name would you like?

EXT. SPACE

The skin of the ship change color subtly and the name on the hull fades from "Ember One" to "O.C.A.S. Unity".

INT. UNITY BRIDGE - DAY

The name also changes in the Captain's personal holographic display.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
"Unity"? How does that strike you, Miss Polywell?

BRIANNA
Um... Uh... Sounds good.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Unity it is. Lieutenant Strata, return us to the shipyard.

CUT TO:

EXT. SHIPYARD

*Unity* docks with the shipyard.

INT. SHIPYARD ENGINEERING OFFICE - EVENING

The engineering team files into the office. Everyone sits down and Tokamak addresses the team.

TOKAMAK
I'd like to congratulate everyone on the success of our test flight. In spite of an issue with the FTL engines, everything went remarkably well. We're going to have to work hard in the next two days, but I'm confident we can be ready to depart on time.

Tokamak pauses for a moment and looks directly at Brianna.

TOKAMAK (CONT.)
To that end, I've decided that all three of you, Mr. Greyson, Miss Patel and Miss Polywell, will be accompanying me to Earth to complete Phase II construction.

Everyone cheers.

TOKAMAK (CONT.)
Go get some sleep. We have a big day tomorrow.

Noah goes to talk to Tokamak while the rest file out of the room.

INT. SHIPYARD CORRIDOR - EVENING

The group walks along the corridor.

BRIANNA
So, you ready to hit the hay?

SAMANTHA
What?

BRIANNA
Are you going to turn in early for the evening?

Samantha smiles.

SAMANTHA
Do I strike you as the kinda girl who goes to bed early?

BRIANNA
Good. You're coming with us.

SAMANTHA
I am?

BRIANNA
Do you trust me?

SAMANTHA
Sure. Why not?

BRIANNA
Good. Do you have a party dress?

SAMANTHA
You mean like a real dress? I don't need one.

Samantha takes out a pair of what look like safety glasses and puts them on Brianna's face.

!BRIANNA'S POV

The surroundings of the old station have been transformed into and extravagant resort with walls of ivory and cedar, and gold-embroidered carpets the color of wine.

Samantha wears a baby blue dress layered with ribbons of sparkling, translucent fabric. Her hair is braided in an elaborate updo and adorned with jewels. Her makeup is perfect and her skin is flawless.

BRIANNA
Is this how you see everything all the time? In some kind of augmented reality paradise?

SAMANTHA
That's how most Venusians see the world. We live in small, cramped floating habitats with limited resources. It helps to see the world with rose-colored glasses.

!BACK TO SCENE

Brianna takes off the glasses and hands them back to Samantha.

BRIANNA
Well, turn it all off. Tonight we're going to show you something real. Cassie, we're going to need a fashion intervention.

INT. JASON AND CASSIDY'S APARTMENT - EVENING

Samantha, Cassidy and Jason enter the apartment.

CASSIDY
Welcome to our humble abode. Shall we get started with your...
(dramatic pause)
...transformation?

!MONTAGE

- Cassidy takes Samantha behind a dressing screen. She give Samantha a series of dresses to try on from her closet.

- While Samantha is still getting dressed, Katy and Brianna arrive in party attire. They help Cassidy find Samantha the perfect dress.

- Cassidy has Samantha try on different shoes while Katy does her makeup and Brianna brushes her rat's nest of hair until it's luscious and shiny.

- Samantha is ready for a night on the town.

!END MONTAGE

Samantha, Brianna and Katy sit down on the bed, joining Jason, while Cassidy goes behind the dressing screen to pick an outfit.

SAMANTHA
So what exactly is it we're doing again?

BRIANNA
Oh, let's just say we're having a little girls' night out.

SAMANTHA
So Jason's not coming with us?

BRIANNA
Oh, he's coming too.

CASSIDY
(from behind the dressing screen)
Jason's an honorary girl.

JASON
Thanks... I think.

BRIANNA
Say, how come you're dressing behind a screen when the only guy in the room is your husband?

Cassidy steps out from behind the screen, fully dressed.

CASSIDY
(with a wicked smile)
I like to make him work for it.

Samantha notices some scars on Cassidy's arms and legs.

SAMANTHA
I don't mean to pry, but what are those scars?

JASON
Oh, you mean these.

Jason pulls his sleeves up to reveal that he has the same scars.

JASON (CONT.)
Cassie and I are space-born Herculaneans, but we were still young children when Herculaneum joined the Alliance, so we were given a series of medical procedures and extensive physical therapy to strengthen our bones and muscles, allowing us to survive in Alliance standard gravity. That's actually how we met, isn't it sweetie?

CASSIDY
I remember the day we met in the hospital. I stole the cookies from your dinner tray.

Jason takes Cassidy by the arm.

JASON
Some things never change.

The group walks out.

INT. STATION CORRIDOR INTERSECTION - NIGHT

As the Girls (and Jason) head to their event, Brianna spots Noah exiting the ship in his work attire.

BRIANNA
Hey, give me a second. I'll catch up.

Brianna walks over to Noah as the gang proceeds. Samantha hangs back, visibly uncomfortable.

BRIANNA
Hi. Did you just finish an extra shift?

NOAH
I volunteered to check the FTL field elements. We don't want any more surprises like we had today.

BRIANNA
That's very thoughtful of you. Say, my friends and I are going to a party, and if you wanted to, you could--you know--maybe come with us and unwind a little after hard day's work.

NOAH
I appreciate the offer, but I'm very tired. I'm not sure I'm up for a party.
(beat)
But I'm not too tired to grab a bite to eat with you in the station's cafeteria.

Brianna thinks about it for a moment. Samantha looks on, biting her thumb nail.

BRIANNA
I'm going to have to take a rain check. I already invited Samantha to the party. It would be rude to bow out now.

NOAH
I understand.

Samantha swoops in and takes Brianna by the arm.

SAMANTHA
Don't worry. I'll make sure she gets back to her room, safe and sound.

She gives Noah and adversarial grin and pulls Brianna forward to catch up with her friends. Noah watches until she's out of sight, frowns slightly, then continues into the station.

INT. UNITY CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The group approaches a door with a sign marked "Warning: Habitat incomplete beyond this point". Cassidy casually pulls the sign off the door and tosses it aside, then presses a button to open the door. The group enters.

INT. UNFINISHED HABITAT - NIGHT

A large, unfinished space is covered with improvised lights and decorations, cables hung all over. The room features a bar, a buffet, a dance floor, various gambling tables, and a rather large inflatable castle.

CASSIDY
Behold, Operation Last Hurrah, the last and greatest party I will ever throw.

Katy's eyes widen in amazement.

KATY
Um, I need to make a call...

She turns around to leave, but Cassidy and Brianna catch her by each arm.

CASSIDY
Oh no you don't.

They spin Katy back around and escort her into the room. Cassidy presses some poker chips into her hand.

CASSIDY
Now take these over to the Blackjack table.

KATY
We've got a Blackjack table?

Katy runs off.

BRIANNA
Wow. This is a rather impressive display of sin and debauchery.

CASSIDY
(taking a bow)
Why, thank you.

Brianna suddenly spots the large inflated structure.

BRIANNA
Is that a zero-G bouncy castle?

CASSIDY
(defensive)
I was pressed for time.

SAMANTHA
(looking around)
So what exactly is this place for?

CASSIDY
This is where they're going to put the Cetacean Habitat when we begin Phase II construction.

BRIANNA
Hey, Sam. Let's get a few drinks.

They begin walking towards the bar.

SAMANTHA
'Sam'? That's rather presumptuous. Only my close friends get to call me that, Bree.

BRIANNA
Is that so?

They arrive at the bar, where a BARTENDING ROBOT is mixing drinks.

ROBOT
What'll it be, ladies?

SAMANTHA
(to Brianna)
So does this bar serve alcohol, or some kind of synthetic substitute?

BRIANNA
Nothing so quaint. These are mood altering beverages. They can make you happy or sad, frightened or brave, or anything else you can think of. Watch.
(addressing the robot)
I'll have time dilation with a bit of joy and a hint of apprehension.

ROBOT
And for flavor?

BRIANNA
Cherry cola?

The robot begins mixing her drink and addresses Samantha.

ROBOT
And for you, ma'am?

Samantha points to a sign behind the robot.

SAMANTHA
What's "One With Everything"?

BRIANNA
Oh, that makes you feel connected to everything in the universe. If this is your first time, you might want to cut it with something.

The robot hands Brianna her finished drink in a sealed container with a straw.

SAMANTHA
Okay, can I get half "One With Everything", half "Thrill Seeker", flavored with spicy chocolate.

ROBOT
A most excellent choice, ma'am.

The robot finishes preparing Samantha's drink and hands it to her. She and Brianna walk towards the dance floor next to a window slanted downward, sipping their drinks. The window is filled with stars.

SAMANTHA
Wow, I can feel the stars, as if I'm going to fall into them forever.
(hands against the window)
It's like they're calling me.

BRIANNA
That's the drink talking.

Samantha, taking a sip from her dring, watches the people on the dance floor, then she extends her hand to Brianna.

SAMANTHA
Look. We must join them and become one with the dance.

Brianna, trying not to giggle, takes her hand, and Samantha leads her onto the dance floor. Then Brianna notices the music change.

BRIANNA
Wait, this is a waltz.

SAMANTHA
It just so happens that the waltz is my specialty. I'll lead.

!MONTAGE

 - Samantha glides gracefully about the dance floor and Brianna fumbles to catch up.

 - Eventually Brianna catches on, and they dance gracefully together, in step with the others.

 - Time slows down, and the dancers glide gracefully in front of the stars, then the colorful lights of the party, and back, over and over again.

!END MONTAGE

The waltz finishes, replaced by a more contemporary pop dance beat. Katy, despondent and chipless, staggers towards them. They pull her onto the dance floor, and the three dance freestyle, making up the moves as they go.

Cassidy, holding a plate of food, watches them longingly.

JASON
You okay, honey?

Cassidy crams her mouth full of hors d'oeuvres, trying not to cry.

CASSIDY
I'm fine. It's just... this is our last big party, and I can't even do half this stuff because I'm pregnant.

She swallows hard, turns to Jason, and beats on his chest a couple of times with the bottom of her fist.

CASSIDY
This is all your fault you know.

She places her head on his chest. Jason kisses her on her forehead and embraces her.

JASON
I know, dear. I know.

Brianna, Samantha and Katy now head for the entrance to the zero-G bouncy castle.

SAMANTHA
Are you sure we're in a state to go in there?

BRIANNA
We're in the perfect state to go in there.

Brianna and Katy push Samantha through the entrance, and she goes flying across to the wall and bounces off. Brianna joins her, bouncing off the wall and grabbing her arm. The two kick off the opposite wall.

Just then, Katy, with a suspicious level of skill, bounces toward them and shoves them back towards the wall, cancelling her own momentum and allowing her to float gracefully in place.

!MONTAGE

 - Brianna, Samantha and Katy form a triangle and spin about like a wheel.

 - Samantha and Katy float side-by-side, each rolled into a ball. Brianna flies in, also rolled into a ball, and hits Samantha, who hits Katy, sending her flying.

 - Brianna and Samantha move slowly towards each other in kick poses from martial arts movies. Katy drifts down and gently "kicks" both of them before we can see who's the victor.

 - The three pretend to swim in the zero-G environment.

!END MONTAGE

Abruptly, the anti-gravity in the bouncy castle cuts out, sending everyone falling to the cushioned floor. Brianna, Samantha and Katy get to the entrance and start helping people out of the castle.

The lights decorating the room become brighter and brighter, until they start to pop and blow out, sending sparks flying. The party goers flea towards the exits, screaming and shouting. Vents roar as they decompress the room, sucking up the smoke from the lights at the same time.

Jason helps Cassidy into...

INT. UNITY CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Everyone stands in the corridor, dazed and confused. Brianna, Katy and Samantha are the last to exit the room, and the door suddenly shuts behind them. A holographic sign appears over the door: "Warning: Atmospheric Decompression."

The lights in the corridor begin to brighten, and everyone flees down the corridor, ahead of the brightening lights. As everyone leaves a previous stretch of corridor, the lights explode, and the door to the section seals behind them.

As they run, Brianna glances at the emergency doors on the sides of the corridor. They're already sealed.

INT. SHIPYARD GANGWAY - NIGHT

The party goers run down the gangway as the outer doors seal and the gangway retracts from the ship.

INT. SHIPYARD OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT

The party goers stare out at the ship. Dozens of panicked conversations go on at once.

INT. SHIPYARD ENGINEERING OFFICE - NIGHT

Brianna, Katy, Cassidy and Jason rush to their workstations. Samantha stands watching at the back of the room.

CASSIDY
I'm not getting any telemetry from the ship's AI core. It looks like the primary communications array is completely offline. Brianna, are you getting anything from the secondary diagnostic system?

BRIANNA
The power grid appears to be functioning properly. I'm not seeing any overloads.

CASSIDY
How is that possible?

BRIANNA
I don't know, but we have another problem: all the power system nodes related to the Kugelblitz reactor are inactive.

The room goes silent for a moment.

CASSIDY
Without those nodes, the only thing stabilizing the micro black hole is gravity being generated from the residual power in the primary superconducting capacitor. Once that power's been drained...

BRIANNA
...The black hole will contract and release exponentially more Hawking radiation until it explodes, vaporizing everything within thirty kilometers.

TOKAMAK (O.S.)
And matter isn't being fed into the micro black hole to reduce the emission of Hawking Radiation?

Tokamak stands just inside the door. The Captain, Oversight and Noah follow him inside.

BRIANNA
Uh... The associated power control processors aren't responding, even through our backup diagnostic system. It's like the entire power system is locked down.

TOKAMAK
Are we getting diagnostic telemetry for the power control systems?

BRIANNA
Yes, and everything reads nominal. However, the systems aren't behaving as designed, and they're not responding to any commands we try to issue through the secondary diagnostic system.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Are we looking at an act of sabotage?

BRIANNA
I don't know how. The DNA and operating system on the power control processors have to be digitally signed, so it can't be hacked directly, and only the primary AI core can override our remote diagnostic commands.

TOKAMAK
So perhaps it's an issue with the ship's AI.

BRIANNA
The facet of Oversight currently installed in the ship's AI core would prevent that.

OVERSIGHT
I have not been able to contact my counterpart aboard the ship for over ten minutes.

KATY
From the diagnostic telemetry, it looks like the temperature of the AI core has risen to fifty two degrees Celsius. At those temperatures, the organic quantum processors that make up the core can't function.

OVERSIGHT
If the ship's AI could raise the temperature in its own core, it might have a brief window of opportunity where it could lock down the power systems without my interference.

BRIANNA
But that's suicide.

KATY
Yes, but it would explain why we were driven from the ship. It didn't want to take us with it.

OVERSIGHT
And given the nature of its initialization, it's difficult to predict the kind of behavior we could expect from such an AI.

TOKAMAK
Miss Polywell?

BRIANNA
The holodisk was missing from the initialization kit, and I didn't have time to find it. We'd already begun the initialization, so I--

OVERSIGHT
She used holo-images of her own family to initialize the AI.

TOKAMAK
(to Brianna)
And when were you going to tell me about this?

Brianna gets up from her station and opens her mouth, as if to say something, but nothing comes out.

TOKAMAK (CONT.)
Never, right?

Brianna answers with silence.

TOKAMAK (CONT.)
Miss Polywell, your employment at this shipyard is terminated, effective immediately. I'm rescinding your access codes, and you have forty eight hours to vacate shipyard housing.

Brianna stands there for a moment, stunned.

TOKAMAK
Noah, get some towing drones on that ship. If we can't get that reactor under control, we need to make sure the ship is towed a safe distance from the inhabited stations around Herculaneum.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Miss Polywell, I'm afraid you're going to have to leave the room now that your security status has been revoked.

Brianna, clearly in shock, manages a nod, then she staggers out of the room.

INT. SHIPYARD OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT

A crowd watches out the windows as towing drones attach to the hull of the *Unity*. Behind them, Brianna shuffles aimlessly towards her apartment.

FIRST CROWD MEMBER
Well, I guess that's the end of the Initiative.

SECOND CROWD MEMBER
What do you mean?

FIRST CROWD MEMBER
They're losing their first ship before it's even finished. That's all Earth and the hypercorps need to get the funding pulled. The Initiative's dead on arrival.

INT. BRIANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Brianna enters and locks the door. She shambles towards her bed, then collapses on it in a sitting position. She runs shaking hands through her hair, choking back tears.

She opens a contact list through her holoband, and scrolls to a contact entitled "Mom". She hesitates for a moment, then closes the contact list.

The door chime rings. Brianna remains motionless. The door chimes again, then, after a moment, the door opens and Katy pops her head in.

KATY
Hey, Brianna. How ya holding up?

BRIANNA
How'd you unlock the door?

Cassidy follows Katy into the room.

CASSIDY
It's pretty easy, considering all of your security privileges have been revoked.

Jason and Samantha walk in behind her.

BRIANNA
Shouldn't you guys be working on getting the ship under control?

CASSIDY
Tokamak's pretty much given up on saving the ship. We're locked out of all the ship's key systems, so we're just waiting for the inevitable.

BRIANNA
So you're all here to cheer me up after I killed the Initiative in the cradle?

JASON
Tokamak may have given up on the *Unity*, but we haven't. You know that ship just as well as he does. If anyone can come up with a plan to save it, it's you.

CASSIDY
Is there any way to issue commands to the power control system remotely?

BRIANNA
The system was designed to be resistant to remote hacking. The secondary diagnostics only work because they're a parallel system with a separate transmitter.

SAMANTHA
Would it be possible for me to use my implant to remotely control one of the repair drones inside the ship to fix the problem.

BRIANNA
Fixing the power control system is too complicated to be done by anyone other than an engineer. I'd have to be physically on the ship to fix it.

SAMANTHA
So why don't we do that?

KATY
Uh, what?

SAMANTHA
Bree, if we can get you to the ship, can you fix the problem?

KATY
She can't get there by shuttle. All flight clearances have been cancelled to prevent people from getting caught in the blast when the ship explodes.

CASSIDY
What about an EVA suit?

BRIANNA
Tokamak will have those under lock and key by now, and my access codes have been revoked anyway. Just about the only way to get there is if you stick me in a spacesuit and shoot me out of a railgun.

Cassidy and Jason look at each other and smile.

BRIANNA
No.

CASSIDY
You know, the old point defense system was never actually removed...

JASON
...So all we'd have to do is reconnect the power to one of the old railguns.

BRIANNA
Look, I'm the one who caused the problem in the first place. I screwed up the AI. How do you guys know I won't just make it worse.

SAMANTHA
Do you really believe that the AI caused this? Because, from what I saw, he was working flawlessly.

BRIANNA
It's uncharted territory. When I initialized him, I was working on a hunch. I had no idea how my decision impacted his neural network, and the first thing it did was to fashion itself into a fantasy of the brother I never had. But he's not my brother. Why should I risk my life for him? He's not my brother.

SAMANTHA
You created him. He looks like your brother because he comes from you...

She puts her hand on Brianna's shoulder.

SAMANTHA (CONT.)
What does that make him to you, Brianna?

Brianna's expression changes from self-pity to resolve.

INT. SHIPYARD CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The entire gang walks down the corridor with purpose.

BRIANNA
I'm still going to need a spacesuit.

SAMANTHA
You can use mine.

BRIANNA
And we need two people to connect up the power to the point defense gun.

CASSIDY
(taking Jason's arm)
We'll handle that.

BRIANNA
Sam, I'm going to need you to help me power up the railgun and operate it once I'm inside the chamber. We still need someone to distract everyone in the Engineering Office so they don't notice the power drain.

KATY
I can do that.

Everyone stops and looks at her incredulously.

KATY
I can. Look, I know you guys think I'm a narc, but I'm your friend, and I've put just as much blood, sweat and tears into that ship as any of you.

Brianna puts her hands on Katy's shoulders, looks her in the eye and smiles.

BRIANNA
I know you won't let me down.

Katy smiles back. The gang continues down the corridor until they reach a four-way junction. Cassidy and Jason turn left, Brianna and Samantha turn right, and Katy continues forward.

CLOSE ON KATY  

Her smile fades to a look of mild panic.

INT. RAILGUN GUNNER STATION - NIGHT

Brianna is showing Samantha how the controls work.

SAMANTHA
So I need to set this to no more than ten megajoules?

BRIANNA
Right.

SAMANTHA
Wouldn't it be safer to lower the power.

BRIANNA
Any lower and I won't be going fast enough to catch up with the ship. Don't worry, I should be able to handle the sudden acceleration because I'm from a high gravity world. Do you have your spacesuit?

SAMANTHA
Yeah, right here. Should be one size fits all. I'll hold your dress.

Brianna turns her back to Samantha.

BRIANNA
Can you unzip me?

SAMANTHA
Sure.

She unzips the back of Brianna's dress.

INT. ELECTRICAL CLOSET - NIGHT

Cassidy finishes connecting up a heavy cable while Jason holds a fuse in the off position.

CASSIDY
Okay, I'm done. All you gotta do is switch the power back on.

JASON
I hope Katy can distract Tokamak, or he'd bound to register the spike in power consumption.

CASSIDY
Too late to worry about that now.

Jason switches on the power.

INT. SHIPYARD ENGINEERING OFFICE - NIGHT

Tokamak sits at his workstation. Katy approaches him from behind.

KATY
Mr. Tokamak?

Just as Tokamak turns his head towards Katy, a notification appears regarding a sudden increase in power consumption on the station. Katy's eyes momentarily dart to the notification, then back to Tokamak.

KATY
I've been looking at the readings from the AI core, and I'm wondering if the increased heat might not have been caused by some sort of contaminant in the computer core instead of tampering by the AI.

TOKAMAK
You're saying that the AI computer core is raising the temperature as some sort of immune response to protect the organic components of the quantum computers?

KATY
Something like that. Maybe the core was accidently exposed to something during installation.

TOKAMAK
Even if that were the case, how would that help us? There's no way we could get the AI core back online before the reactor goes critical.

The notification times out and disappears.

KATY
I suppose you're right sir. I'll keep working on it.

TOKAMAK
You do that.

INT. ELECTRICAL CLOSET - NIGHT

CASSIDY
Well, that's it. When was the last time we did something like this?

JASON
A few hours ago?

Cassidy steps closer to him.

CASSIDY
No, I mean like really illegal?

She presses herself right up against Jason, her hand on his shoulder.

JASON
You mean like the night we broke into the schoolmaster's secret apartment and partied all night drinking the booze from his liquor cabinet?

Cassidy's face is so close to his, their lips are nearly touching.

CASSIDY
Oh yeah.
(smiles and puts her arms around him)
I remember that one.

Cassidy presses him against the wall in a passionate kiss. Jason puts one arm around her. His other hand flails frantically for the door switch, which he eventually finds. The door closes.

INT. RAILGUN GUNNER STATION - NIGHT

SAMANTHA
We have power.

BRIANNA
Okay, do it just like we practiced. Once I'm in the chamber and ready, I'll give you the signal, then you aim just ahead of the ship and fire, got it?

SAMANTHA
Got it.

Brianna, dressed in Samantha's spacesuit, opens the inspection hatch and climbs into...

INT. RAILGUN CHAMBER

Brianna closes the hatch and presses a button on the suit collar to deploy the helmet.

BRIANNA
Okay, take the railgun out of inspection mode and move it into firing position.

SAMANTHA (O.S.)
Rodger.

Everything vibrates as the railgun shifts position, and there's a hiss as the air evacuates from the chamber.

BRIANNA
(to herself)
This has to be the stupidest thing I've ever done.

SAMANTHA (O.S.)
What was that?

BRIANNA
Nothing.

INT. SHIPYARD ENGINEERING OFFICE - NIGHT

TOKAMAK
Miss Patel, where are the other engineers? They should be back by now.

KATY
Oh, they're busy working on something.

TOKAMAK
Like what?

Katy hesitates.

KATY
Well, you know, they had that thing they needed to work on from the other day and--

TOKAMAK
Miss Patel, you're a terrible liar. Just tell me where they are.

KATY
I... can't... tell you, sir.

TOKAMAK
Talk. What are your friends up to?

KATY
Friends don't rat on each other.

TOKAMAK
What are you talking about? You rat on your friends all the time.

KATY
Not when it counts.

Out of the corner of his eye, Tokamak notices the railgun rotating into firing position.

TOKAMAK
Tell me that Miss Polywell isn't about to fire herself out of a cannon.

KATY
Well, uh...

EXT. RAILGUN

The railgun fires.

!CUT TO BLACK

FADE IN:

EXT. SPACE - BRIANNA'S POV

At first all the stars are red, but their true colors slowly return.

EXT. SPACE

Brianna sees the *O.C.A.S. Unity* ahead, growing larger. The engines of the towing drones continue to fire. She passes the ship, but her speed slows in comparison the the ship, and the ship begins to gain on her.

Brianna uses her maneuvering thrusters to put herself in the ship's path, looking for the airlock. She finds her target, but the ship is coming up on her too fast. She fires her thrusters again, this time to slow her "descent".

Brianna plants hard on the airlock door. She crawls over to a panel, presses a few buttons and pulls a handle, then falls through the airlock door as it opens.

INT. SHIPYARD ENGINEERING OFFICE - NIGHT

The Captain enters the room. Tokamak and Noah are waiting.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Status.

TOKAMAK
Looks like Polywell was even more of a loose canon than I thought. She used one of our old railguns to board the ship.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Is there any way to communicate with her?

TOKAMAK
The ship's too far away for short range comms, and the diagnostic system we have installed isn't designed for conventional communications.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Is there enough time to retrieve her before the reactor goes critical?

TOKAMAK
Just barely.
(turns around)
Noah?

INT. UNITY ENGINEERING ROOM - NIGHT

The room is lit only by emergency lighting. Panels on the walls flash warnings of atmospheric decompression.

A fusion reactor, partly submerged into the floor, has a short set of stairs and a walkway that lead to the center top.

At the end of the walkway, a panel has been opened, and Brianna hands dance about as she works on the organic processor inside. Diagnostic equipment are plugged into various output ports.

Brianna looks at her holoband, and it displays a message: "Cryptographic Hash Confirmed".

NOAH (O.S.)
So there you are.

Noah approaches from a distance, in an EVA suit augmented by a construction exoframe, which is designed for flight in deep space.

BRIANNA
Hey, Noah. Come up here, I wanna show you something.

NOAH
Tokamak sent me to come get you before the Kugelblitz reactor goes critical--

BRIANNA
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on up. I've checked the operating system stored on the main EPROM, and its cryptographic hash matches the one we have on file, which means nobody's tampered with it. If the problem is an instruction issued by the AI core, rebooting the power control processor should clear the memory and allow the processor to revert to its default programming. That should allow it to stabilize the black hole.

NOAH
Brianna, Tokamak estimates that we only have about three minutes to successfully clear the blast range, and that's if we leave right now.

BRIANNA
Actually, we have more like twenty minutes. Remember that superconductive capacitor ring that we were supposed to replace?

NOAH
Uh, yeah.

BRIANNA
Well, I didn't so much replace it as I hooked it up in parallel with the new one.

NOAH
And Tokamak has no idea?

Brianna gives an uncomfortable grin and shrug as confirmation.

NOAH
(to himself)
So my time calculations are complete off.

BRIANNA
I'm ready to power off the processor. Once we switch it back on, we'll know it worked if the power output from the fusion reactor spikes.

She flips a toggle switch, and all the lights inside the panel go dark. The high energy hum of electronics ceases.

BRIANNA
Cross your fingers.

She flips the switch back on, and the electronics hum to life. She checks the power output of the fusion reactor on a graph displayed by her holoband, but after waiting for a moment, the power being generated is minimal.

BRIANNA
I don't understand. This should have worked.

Brianna remains in focus while Noah is blurred behind her. Noah removes a metal rod from the guard rail.

BRIANNA
It's a clean system. The reboot should have restored the OS to factory default. The only thing that's left is if...

Noah, in the blurred background, walks toward Brianna and lifts the rod up to strike.

BRIANNA
...someone altered the DNA of the biochips.

Brianna turns just as Noah strikes. She manages to dodge, slipping off the catwalk onto the shell of the fusion reactor. She slides down the side into the gap between the grated floor and the reactor shell.

Brianna scurries on hand and knee around the subfloor under the grates, crawling over cables and pipes. Noah walks around above her, searching with a spotlight on his exoframe. The light projects through the grating onto the subfloor near her, and she evades it.

NOAH'S POV

Noah activates "Short-Range Signal Triangulation" on his HUD.

!BACK TO SCENE

NOAH
I bet I know what you're thinking. How did I hack the DNA upgrade if the biochips require a digital signature from the factory?

Brianna has a eureka moment.

BRIANNA
You have an inside man at the factory.

Noah pulls the grating from above Brianna's head with his exoframe's right hand.

NOAH
There you are.

He grabs Brianna's helmet with the exoframe's left hand and lifts her up into the air. Brianna pulls on the mechanical fingers, but can't break his grip.

NOAH
Don't bother. This exoframe was designed to augment the strength of your fellow Herculaneans.

BRIANNA
So the problem with the FTL wasn't an accident, was it?

NOAH
I made slight changes to the specifications sent to the manufacturer.

BRIANNA
But you were on the ship. You would have died too.

NOAH
I do what my faith demands of me. When you claimed to be a woman of faith yourself, I had hoped you might understand, but after watching you fawn over those Godless transhumans for the past few days, I knew you would not.

Noah tosses away the grating and strides toward a railing that overlooks the deck more than eight meters below. Brianna gazes in terror at the floor below.

BRIANNA
How'd you disable the AI.

NOAH
When you asked me to fix your holoband, I saw a unique opportunity. I was already planning to sabotage the reactors, but I still needed to disable the AI core, so I arranged for you to be the one to initialize the ship's AI and planted a viral deployment mechanism in your holoband.

BRIANNA
But Oversight's resistant to virtually any form of computer virus.

Noah pulls her in closer so they're face to face.

NOAH
I never said it was a computer virus.

BRIANNA
You used a biological virus to attack the organic components of the AI core? What about immune response?

NOAH
A common immune response is a fever. Raise the temperature high enough, and an organic computer ceases to function.

BRIANNA
So it'll eventually come back online?

NOAH
Not in time to save your precious ship. Or you for that matter.

He lifts Brianna over the railing and dangles her high above the floor. Brianna instinctively grips the mechanical hand in terror and kicks her legs around helplessly.

NOAH
Afraid of heights are we?

BRIANNA
You'll never get away with this.

NOAH
Of course I will. I'll just tell them I didn't make it in time. All the evidence will be vaporized when the Kugelblitz reactor goes critical.
(beat)
But I don't have to kill you. You could come quietly with me and return to the shipyard.

BRIANNA
Why would you do that, when I could just tell them you sabotaged the ship?

NOAH
Because you have no credibility.

Noah smiles in triumph, then squeezes Brianna's helmet, causing it to crack.

NOAH
Better decide quickly.

!BRIANNA'S POV

A warning displays on her HUD warning that the suit pressure is dropping. Brianna's panicked breathing grows more labored as the pressure drops. Her hands press against the cracks to hold back the air. Then, Brianna's attention turns to something on Noah's EVA suit within the exoframe: the number "8".

!BACK TO SCENE

Behind her back, Brianna carefully reaches for a screwdriver on her belt.

BRIANNA
I...
(cough)
I... Have an answer.

Noah pulls her in closer.

NOAH
What is it?

BRIANNA
Go to Hell.

Using all of her strength, she thrusts her screwdriver into the exoframe's oxygen tank. Gas erupts from the punctured tank. Startled, Noah drops Brianna.

She grabs for the railing, but she's a few centimeters out of reach. Mortal terror spreads across her face as she falls. She sees a cable just in reach and grabs it. One end is pulled out immediately, then the rest of the cable slips through her hand and she continues to fall, hitting the floor hard.

Noah gazes down over the railing, watching for signs of life. Brianna lays motionless for a moment, then sits up, checking to see if anything's broken.

BRIANNA
(to herself)
Of course. The gravity's only one G.

She gets up and runs into a narrow service corridor nearby. Noah flies down to follow, but the opening is too small for his exoframe. He reaches in, but just misses grabbing her.

INT. UNITY SERVICE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Brianna uses a tool from her belt to seal the cracks in her helmet. She then notices a pipe labelled "Biochip Nutrient Feed" and follows it to a junction with an access port. Other pipes radiate out and up towards the fusion reactors.

Brianna pops open the case on her holoband and finds a small viral deployment device. She opens the port, injects the contents of the device and closes the port.

NOAH (O.S.)
There's only so many ways to get out of those service corridors, Brianna, and considering the fact that you've just lost most of your oxygen, I'd say you don't have very long before you suffocate.

Brianna turns the corner towards a side exit, but a line of red-hot metal runs up the seam of the door. It's welded shut.

NOAH (O.S.)
I know every corridor and crawlway just as well as you do.

She tries the door on the opposite side, and we see sparks coming from the two halves of the door as they're being welded together.

Brianna spots a hatch with a sign that says the following:  

     Hatch cannot be open while hallway is pressurized.

Brianna pops the hatch and it comes off easily. She drops down.

INT. UNITY TRANSIT TUNNEL - NIGHT

Brianna lands on her feet, walks over to a panel, and summons a transit car. Across the room, a door opens, and Brianna runs and hides behind a support column.

NOAH (O.S.)
You know, Brianna, you always saw yourself as the best engineer on the team, but nothing could be further from the truth.

Brianna presses tightly against the column as a dark shape emerges from the door in the background.

NOAH (O.S.)
You show up late to every meeting.

The shape walks out of view.

NOAH (O.S.)
You coast on the reputations of your famous parents.

Brianna glances quickly around the corner of the column to see if anyone is there. Seeing no one, she runs to a column closer to the transit platform.

NOAH (O.S.)
You think you're better than a senior engineer like Tokamak, second guessing every decision he makes and actively undermining his authority.

In the distance, the transit car approaches.

NOAH (O.S.)
The truth is, you couldn't even fix your own holoband. You gave it to me to fix.

BRIANNA
But you didn't fix it, did you?

Noah steps out from behind the column where Brianna's hiding.

NOAH
Gotcha.

As he reaches for Brianna, she leaps upward, dodging his grip and landing on his shoulders. She leaps again, landing in the transit car, which has just arrived.

She grabs a lever on the car's controls, throttling it all the way forward. The car races off.

NOAH
It won't be that easy.

Noah uses the thrusters on his exoframe to pursue Brianna. In the distance, he sees her stop at a junction and run out of the car into a nearby corridor.

SPACESUIT (O.S.)
Warning: Oxygen low.

Noah lands near transit car and turns toward the corridor.

NOAH
I warned you about your oxygen. Sounds like you're about to run out.

INT. UNITY CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Noah strides confidently down the corridor without stopping.

NOAH
I know where you're going. It's a bit predictable, don't you think?

INT. EVA SUIT ROOM - NIGHT

As Noah enters the room, Brianna finishes fiddling inside a wall panel and closes it. She holds an oxygen bottle under one arm, taken from a rack nearby.

SPACESUIT (O.S.)
Warning: Oxygen low.

NOAH
Please connect that oxygen bottle. I'm getting tired of hearing your suit drone on about oxygen.

BRIANNA
That isn't my suit.

NOAH
Pardon?

BRIANNA
That's not my suit, Noah. I've already replenished my oxygen. The warnings are coming from your EVA suit.

NOAH'S EVA SUIT (O.S.)
One minute of oxygen remaining. Seek emergency oxygen immediately.

BRIANNA
Oh, did I forget to refill the oxygen on EVA Suit #8? I'm such an incompetent engineer that it completely slipped my mind.

Noah grabs the oxygen bottle from her and tries to attach it to his EVA Suit, but the exoframe he's wearing is blocking the suit's connector for the oxygen bottle.

BRIANNA (CONT.)
You forgot that you can't use oxygen bottles while you're wearing an exoframe.

Noah presses the release on his exoframe, and it opens up. He steps confidently out of his exoframe and removes a knife from a pouch. He twirls the knife around with expert skill.

NOAH
You might be stronger, but you're not trained in close combat.

BRIANNA
I don't have to be.

She presses a button on the wall panel, which displays the gravity. It increases from "1.00 G" to "4.01 G". Noah stumbles to the floor, dropping his knife. He struggles to get up, but collapses back to the floor.

NOAH'S EVA SUIT (O.S.)
Thirty seconds of oxygen remaining.

Noah crawls towards the exoframe, trying to reach for the oxygen bottle still in its hand, but the bottle is hopelessly out of reach.

Brianna steps forward and pulls the bottle from the exoframe's hand.

NOAH'S EVA SUIT (O.S.)
Fifteen seconds of oxygen remaining.

Noah begins to gasp for air. He turns onto his back and reaches up in a plea for help to Brianna until his arm grows too tired for him to lift. Brianna picks up the knife on the floor and tucks it into a pouch on her suit.

BRIANNA
You know, I thought we had something in common. I thought that we worshipped the same God. But I don't think that's true.

NOAH'S EVA SUIT (O.S.)
Warning: Oxygen Depleted.

Noah's gasps becomes more labored. He'll soon pass out.

BRIANNA
Yours is a God of vengeance...

Brianna reaches down and connects the oxygen bottle to his EVA suit.

BRIANNA
...Whereas mine is a God of compassion.

As Noah's breathing returns to normal, the emergency lighting is replaced by full normal lighting. Sounds of systems starting back up echo through the halls.

BRIANNA
Looks like the Kugelblitz reactor has stabilized.

NOAH
How?

BRIANNA
You gave me the idea. The power control processors are organic computers, just like the AI core, but they have a radically different immune response. I put your virus into their nutrient supply, and the biochips reacted by purging the affected cells and regrowing them from the older, factory default DNA.
(smiles)
Sorry to undo all your hard work.

Brianna turns Noah over onto his stomach. She produces a length of cable and uses it as a rope to tie his hands behind his back.

BRIANNA
And by the way, I didn't need your help to fix my holoband. I broke it on purpose so that you could fix it for me. I was trying to get your attention. How stupid is that?

A spray of vapor comes from the vents, accompanied by the sound of rushing air. Signs that previously warned of decompression now say "Atmosphere Restored". Brianna removes her helmet.

BRIANNA
That would be the AI core coming back online.

!CLOSE UP ON BRIANNA'S HOLOBAND

A holographic message just above the surface of the holoband reads: "New file uploaded."

!BACK TO SCENE

TOKAMAK (INTERCOM)
...Does anyone read me? Primary communications are back online. What's going on over there?

BRIANNA
All systems have been restored.

TOKAMAK (INTERCOM)
Is Mr. Greyson alright?

BRIANNA
He's alright, but I had to tie him up.

TOKAMAK (INTERCOM)
Excuse me?

BRIANNA
He's a saboteur. I'll explain the details later. Can you have Lieutenant Stratus remotely pilot *Unity* back to the shipyard?

EXT. SHIPYARD

*Unity* pulls into the shipyard and docks. A gangway extends and connects to the ship.

INT. SHIPYARD GANGWAY - NIGHT

GUARDS escort Noah off the *Unity*. Brianna follows and is met by the Captain.

INT. SHIPYARD CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Captain Le Guin and Brianna walk the length of a long corridor.

BRIANNA
Captain, there's something you should know. The only way Noah could have hacked the power system processors--

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
--Is if they had an inside man at the factory.

Brianna is taken aback.

BRIANNA
How'd you know?

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Don't look so surprised. Military-grade hardware like those processors are supposed to be hardened against such attacks. The only way someone could compromise them is if they had someone on the inside. I've already contacted the proper authorities on the matter.

BRIANNA
So what's going to happen to Noah?

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
He'll be held for interrogation. Eventually, he'll go to trial, at which point you may be called to give testimony, but I wouldn't worry too much about that right now.

The two reach the end of the corridor and enter...

INT. SHIPYARD ENGINEERING OFFICE - NIGHT

Tokamak is waiting.

TOKAMAK
You wanted to speak with me, sir?

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
How long will it take you to repair the damage and return the ship to operational status.

TOKAMAK
I don't think there's any significant damage. Some of the lights are blown out, but nothing serious. We can be underway within seventy-two hours.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Excellent. I have one other issue to discuss with you. As you know, Miss Polywell was instrumental in recovering the ship safely and revealing our saboteur. Under our contract, I can't order you to take her back as part of your staff. However, given the selfless nature of her actions, I would be remiss if I didn't suggest that you reconsider her termination.

TOKAMAK
I'm afraid my decision regarding Miss Polywell's termination is final.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
I understand.
(to Brianna)
Do you know why he won't take you back, Miss Polywell?

BRIANNA
Well, I kept vital information from him about the ship's artificial intelligence, and although it worked out for the best, I conspired with the other engineers against him. So, he'd probably say that he can't trust me--

TOKAMAK
That about sums it up.

BRIANNA (CONT.)
But the truth is that I don't deserve to be taken back because I didn't trust him.
(to Tokamak)
I didn't trust your judgment regarding the configuration of the power system, so I substituted my own, and that provided Noah with the opening he needed. I used my infected holoband during the initialization because I didn't want to call you and tell you I screwed up. I didn't even tell my friends afterward, because I was afraid they'd say something and I'd lose my ticket to Earth.
(beat)
Mr. Tokamak, I know you won't take me back, but I want you to know that I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.

Tokamak gives a single accepting nod in response.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
(to Brianna)
Well, Mr. Tokamak may no longer want your services, but I have an alternative. I have the power to employ a limited number of experts as warrant officers. On paper, that's what you'd be, but aboard my ship you'd be starting out with the lowest acting rank possible, as an acting Crewman Recruit. Everyone you work with will hold higher rank, and your supervisor will continue to be Mr. Tokamak just as before.

The Captain gives Brianna a moment to let what he's saying sink in.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN (CONT.)
Furthermore, you will be required to complete the virtual training courses for both enlisted and warrant officers, and you must serve for a term no less than five years. If you fail to meet any of these conditions or perform to my satisfaction, you will spend the remainder of your five years in a stockade.

CLOSE ON BRIANNA  

CAPTAIN LE GUIN (O.S.)
So what say you, Miss Polywell? Do you still want to serve aboard my ship?

CUT TO:

INT. ENTRANCE TO SHIPYARD GANGWAY - DAY

Brianna walks up in an Initiative enlisted engineer's uniform, a large duffle bag slung over her shoulder.

Her parents, Aiden and Seraphina Polywell are there to say goodbye. Aiden is wearing a small exoskeleton to support him in the shipyard's gravity. They all embrace. Jason and Cassidy approach, and Brianna embraces them as well.

BRIANNA
I expect baby pictures.

As she walks away, a less friendly face is also waiting for her.

OVERSIGHT
I think I'll be watching you very closely, Miss Polywell.

BRIANNA
Right back at you.

She walks past him without hesitation.

INT. UNITY BRIDGE - DAY

Tokamak turns as Brianna enters the bridge.

TOKAMAK
What's she doing here?

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
I invited her.

TOKAMAK
Isn't it against protocol for an enlisted crewmember to be on the bridge?

The captain glances back from their chair.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Don't you think we can make a one-time exception, given the historical significance of the occasion?

Tokamak hesitates.

TOKAMAK
I suppose. Just this one time.

Samantha enters the bridge, wearing a crisp new Initiative uniform. Her hair is well groomed in a neat updo, and there is a hint of makeup on her face. The Captain tries not to look surprised as she takes the pilot seat.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Lieutenant Stratus, take us out.

EXT. SHIPYARD

The *Unity* departs.

EXT. SPACE

The ship enters FTL.

INT. UNITY BRIDGE - DAY

SAMANTHA (INTERCOM)
We've reached a cruising velocity of four thousand c.

TOKAMAK
All systems are nominal.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Very well. Lieutenant Stratus, bring us to event velocity.

The Captain's holographic display of the ship's systems shows its velocity climbing from "4,000c" to "4,128c".

SAMANTHA (INTERCOM)
Event velocity reached.

CAPTAIN LE GUIN
Jump.

EXT. SPACE

*Unity*'s nacelles fold inward toward the ship to form a ring, which glows brightly. A wormhole opens up in front of the ship. *Unity* enters and disappears.

FADE OUT
